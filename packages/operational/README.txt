Track Admin area activity 

== Description ==

Track and receive notifications for who logged in, who changed the theme, who activated/deactivated a plugin, failed login attempts, password requests, etc.

Note: This plugin required a tune account. Tune is a SaaS Event tracker tool for tech products.

Why use this?

- Event logs are stored on external servers. If your website goes down, your logs don't go down.
- With existing Wordpress activity log plugins, they add logs in your Wordpress website, which might slow down your website
- Unlike Wordpress activity log plugins, you can receive mobile notifications for your activity logs.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `tune.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
