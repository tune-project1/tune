Receive notifications when users cancel their accounts or subscriptions.

### Why This Matters

It's worthwhile to get notified when a user cancels their paid plan. Understanding why customers leave can help you debug issues and take measures to reduce churn. By identifying trends and common pain points, you can setup solutions to retain more customers.

We used this same tactic at Swipekit to reduce our churn by 4%.

## Basic Implementation

Send an event when a user cancels their account. In this implementation, it's also useful to pass a reason for the cancellation - if you have a custom cancellation form.

Otherwise, if you're using Stripe, you can extract the reason from the charge object.

Additionally, passing usage metrics (such as how often the user engaged with your product) can help determine whether the user is worth reaching out to for feedback or retention efforts.

<div slot="default">
<Item initialExpand="true" client:only
  item={{
    name: "user cancelled",
    avatar: "ðŸ˜©",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    type : "rows",
    content : [
      {
        label : 'Name',
        content : 'Shash'
      },
      {
        label : 'Email',
        content : 'shash@tune'
      },
    ]
  }}
></Item>
</div>
<div slot="node">
<Code client:only>
```
const e = {
  name: "a critical event",
  avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
  actions : [
    {
      url : 'https://webhook.site',
      buttonText : 'Press me'
    }
  ]
};
```
</Code>
</div>
</CodeWrap>

## Adding Actions

Tracking cancellations is great, but you might want to add actions for certain scenarios to improve your workflow:

- Send reason email. Ask them why are they leaving and what can you do to stop this.
- Send offer email. Give them 3 months off their plan if you resubscribe, or something similar. This might get them back.

      },

        content : 'Tune'
      },
      {
        label : 'IP',
        content : '123.456.789.1'
      },
    ],
    actions : [

        key : 'activate_user',
        url : 'https://api.tune/demo'
      },
      {
        buttonText : 'Send offer email',
        key : 'ban_domain',
        url : 'https://api.tune/demo'
      }
    ]
  }}

      {

        content : 'Tune'
      },
      {
        label : 'IP',
        content : '123.456.789.1'
      },
    ],
    actions : [
      {
        buttonText : 'Send reason email',
        key : 'activate_user',
        url : 'https://api.tune/demo'
      },
      {
        buttonText : 'Send offer email',
        key : 'ban_domain',
        url : 'https://api.tune/demo'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```
</Code>
</div>
</CodeWrap>

## Conclusion

Tracking user cancellations is more than just receiving a notification. By implementing event tracking, actions, and contextual insights, you can figure out why customers leave, and take steps to reduce churn. Prioritizing these measures will help you retain more paying customers and improve your churn rate.
