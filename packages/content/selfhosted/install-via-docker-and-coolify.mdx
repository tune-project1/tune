# Install via Docker image & Coolify

Coolify is a Docker manager. It can control your VPS and install applications for you.

Here's a video on setting up Tune via Coolify:

**Steps**

1. Setup a VPS
2. Connect Coolify to VPS
3. Setup a Coolify project
4. Create a mysql database
  Save the connection string for env vars

5. Setup a Docker image
  Get the Docker image url from [here](https://github.com/tune-co/tune/pkgs/container/tune).
6. Enter env vars
  You'll need these vars:

  - APP_URL: set this to the default url Coolify assigns(you can change this later on)
  - DATABASE_URL: set this as the connection string of the mysql database you've setup earlier
  - PORT: set this to 2000
  - VITE_API_URL: set this to the backend url

You'll need to also create a backend url manually. To do this, copy this code and paste it inside your Coolify Docker image's container label textarea:
<Code lang="bash">
```
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.rule=Host(`api-yourfrontendurl`)
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.entryPoints=http
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.service=backend-4337
traefik.http.services.backend-4337.loadbalancer.server.port=4337
```
</Code>

And replace the api-yourfrontendurl with the frontend url from Coolify, but prepend `api-` before it.

And paste this in the VITE_API_URL as the value

7. Deploy

Keeping your database seperate from the Docker application is a good idea because you can easily update your docker image in the future if needed, and your database will be intact.

If you're using something like Dokploy, Komo.do, etc, the steps are almost same. What differs between these platforms is how they handle urls and ports.
