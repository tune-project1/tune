# Install via Docker

Tune can be installed via docker-compose.

### Step 1. Install Docker

For local installations, you can install [Docker desktop from here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).

On your server, you'll need to install docker and docker-compose via the command line.

### Step 2. Clone the repo

Clone the repo at https://github.com/tune-co/tune

### Step 3. Create .env files

- Once cloned, cd into the repo.
- Create a .env file in the folder
- Create a .env file in the /backend folder
- Add this in the .env for /backend:
DATABASE_URL=""


### Step 4. Run docker compose

In the repo folder, run `docker-compose up`

This will setup:

- mysql 8.x
- `/app` directory which will serve static html via nginx
- `/backend` nodejs app

## Hosting via docker

The above setup is great for getting started locally.

However for your main setup, you want to add this .env to /backend

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
DATABASE_URL=""

# Eg https://xyz.com
APP_URL="" 

# Optional. Set vapid details for push notifications. Generate your vapid details from https://tools.reactpwa.com/vapid
VAPID_EMAIL=""
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=""
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# Nodejs env, defaults to development. Set it to production when hosting online.
NODE_ENV="development"

# Port. Defaults to 2000
PORT="2000"

# Secret hash. DON'T LEAVE THIS EMPTY. Use a random id generator to generate a hash, eg: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
SECRET=""

# ["http://localhost:8080"] Allows cors from this url. If APP_URL is set, that will be used instead.
# Set a cors url to override the current url
# /api/v1/ingest is allowed from all urls so it can receive events without any cors issue.
# Set this value to "*" to allow all urls
CORS=""
```
</Code>
