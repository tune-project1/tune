# Docker

Tune can be installed via docker-compose.

- Make sure Docker is installed on your system
- Git clone the repo
- cd inside the repo and run `docker-compose up --build`

This will setup

- mysql 8.x
- /app directory which will serve static html via nginx
- /backend nodejs app

Docker compose will automatically create a .env file and set the SECRET and DATABASE_URL env vars.

However if you're hosting via docker, you want to create a .env file in the root of the project before running docker-compose.

Here's a basic .env if you want to host on https://xyz.com

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
# mysql database connection string, eg: mysql://mysql-user:mysql-password@host:port/db-name
DATABASE_URL=""

APP_URL="" 

# Optional. Set vapid details for push notifications. Generate your vapid details from https://tools.reactpwa.com/vapid
VAPID_EMAIL=""
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=""
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# Nodejs env, defaults to development. Set it to production when hosting online.
NODE_ENV="development"

# Port. Defaults to 2000
PORT="2000"

# Secret hash. DON'T LEAVE THIS EMPTY. Use a random id generator to generate a hash, eg: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
SECRET=""

# ["http://localhost:8080"] Allows cors from this url. If APP_URL is set, that will be used instead.
# Set a cors url to override the current url
# /api/v1/ingest is allowed from all urls so it can receive events without any cors issue.
# Set this value to "*" to allow all urls
CORS=""
```
</Code>
