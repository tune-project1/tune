Tune has a nice onboarding process where you will be asked to create your account.

By default, Tune will be accessible on localhost:8080. Go there and you will be guided though the process.

Here are the steps:

### Check connection

This is a basic check to see whether the app can connect to the server.

If yes, it will show you some stats about the server.
If no, it will tell you what went wrong. Most likely this is due to cors issues.

### Create your account

This form will create your account and project.

Once created you can't create another account(unless you delete your account from the database) and the onboarding steps won't show up again.

### Api key

You will be shown your API key.

That's all.

Remember that inside the Playground all code examples should work out-of-the-box since they will have your api key and the baseUrl will be set to your API_URL.
