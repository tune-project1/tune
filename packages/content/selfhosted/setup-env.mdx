# Setup env vars

Env vars control how the server will function. For hosted deployments, read through the env var documentation - you might need to change a few things around before going into prod.

## Backend setup

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
# REQUIRED. mysql database connection string, eg: mysql://mysql-user:mysql-password@host:port/db-name
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:gjkesbgkjak@19.43.119.82:2000/tune" 

# Optional. Set vapid details for push notifications. Generate your vapid details from https://tools.reactpwa.com/vapid
VAPID_EMAIL=""
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=""
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# Nodejs env, defaults to development. Set it to production when hosting online.
NODE_ENV="development"

# Port. Defaults to 2000
PORT="2000"

# Secret hash. DON'T LEAVE THIS EMPTY. Use a random id generator to generate a hash, eg: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
SECRET=""

# ["http://localhost:8080"] Url of the frontend
APP_URL=""

# ["http://localhost:8080"] Allows cors from this url. If APP_URL is set, that will be used instead.
# Set a cors url to override the current url
# /api/v1/ingest is allowed from all urls so it can receive events without any cors issue.
# Set this value to "*" to allow all urls
CORS=""

# [120] Removes events older than 120 days
REMOVE_EVENTS_AT=""

# [7] Removes old test events older than 7 days
REMOVE_TEST_EVENTS_AT=""


# [""] Set this to the url you've configured in resend(or in your smtp email provider). If not set, emails will saved as txt files inside /backend/private
ADMIN_EMAIL=""

# [""] Use resend.com for email sending. They have a free plan available.
# If you don't want to use resend, get smtp credentials from your email provider and enter them(see smtp env vars below)
RESENT=""

SMTP_HOST=""
SMTP_PORT=""
SMTP_USERNAME=""
SMTP_PASSWORD=""
```
</Code>

## App setup

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
# REQUIRED. Set this the to url your api server is accessible to. Defaults to http://localhost:2000

VITE_PUSH_SERVER_KEY=""
```
</Code>
