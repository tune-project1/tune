# Install on your VPS server

For under $10 p/m you can host Tune on a rock-solid virtual private server(VPS).

## Install on a fresh VPS server

This is the fastest method to install Tune. This method requires that:

- You have setup a VPS server and are logged in as root
- You have configured 2 domain names(one for frontend, one for backend) for your instance.

After that, run this inside your VPS as root.


<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tune-co/tune/master/bin/setup-vps.sh -o setup-vps.sh && sudo bash setup-vps.sh
```
</Code>

This script will:

- Install nginx
- Install nodejs
- Install pm2
- Install mysql
- Install certbot
- Configure nginx and certbot
- Pull the repo and install dependencies
- Setup Webpush
- Create .env files
- Configure UFW for basic security measures
- Start the server

## Security

This guide should be enough to get you up and runnings, however we recommend:

- You install fail2ban and configure it
- Make sure your server has ssh key auth and not password auth
- Configure ssh to work on a non-default port

These steps are a bit overkill if you're using Tune as a internal tool, but we recommend doing this for peace of mind.

If you're new to VPS hosting, there are scripts out there to one-shot secure your server.

## Maintainence

### Updating Tune

If you wish to update your copy of Tune, perform these steps:

- ssh inside your server
- go to /home/tune.go
- run `git fetch origin`. If this doesn't work, set your git remove to tune's github repo.
- cd to `/app` and run `npm run build`
- restart nodejs by running `pm2 restart 0`

### Accessing mysql

You might need to access your mysql database directly via Sequel Ace or other Db viewer.

To do this,

- ssh inside your server
- run `sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp`. This will allow outside connections
- run `nano /root/.passwords`. This is where the root and tune_user passwords are stored.

Use the passwords to access your mysql installation.

## Server recommendations

- We recommended Hetzner because they have the best bang-for-your-buck pricing. But really, any VPS provider will work.
- Tune doesn't require much ram. We recommend at least 1 gb of ram but it will run on lower ram too.
- We recommend ubuntu 20.x,22.x or 24.x for the server OS.
