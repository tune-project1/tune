# Install on your VPS server

For under $10 p/m you can host Tune in a rock-solid environment.

Here's how.

## Install on a fresh VPS server

This is the fastest method to install Tune. This method requires that:

- You have setup a VPS server and are logged in as root
- You have configured 2 domain names(one for frontend, one for backend) for your instance.

Once configured, run this inside your VPS as root.


<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tune-co/tune/master/bin/setup-vps.sh -o setup-vps.sh && sudo bash setup-vps.sh
```
</Code>

This script will:

- Install nginx
- Install nodejs
- Install pm2
- Install mysql
- Install certbot
- Configure nginx and certbot
- Pull the repo and install dependencies
- Create .env files
- Start the server

This method doesn't setup Vapid keys for push notifications. This can be easily done by generating your vapid keys from https://www.attheminute.com/au/vapid-key-generator and setting them as [env vars](/selfhosted/setup-env) inside `/backend`.

## Install manually on your VPS

Follow these steps to install Tune manually on your VPS.

### Step 1. Setup a Virtual private server(VPS)

We recommend Hetzner for the most bang-for-your-buck.

Alternatives like Digital Ocean, OVHCloud, Linode, Vultr etc are also good.

### Step 2. Install requirements

You'll need to have nginx installed and configured.

You'll also need 2 domains that's linked to your server. Subdomains is also fine.

First domain points to the frontend `/app`
Second domain points to the backend `/backend`

The application itself requires:

- nodejs 18.x minimum
- mysql 8.x

Install these and make sure nodejs and mysql service* is running.

If you're hosting mysql elsewhere, make sure you have the connection string ready.

### Step 3. Install application

Install by either:

Running the script on our [homepage](https://tune).

or,

Running `git clone https://github.com/tune-co/tune.git` (you'll need git to be installed on your server)

Once done, create .env files inside `/app` and `/backend`.

Configure your env vars. [Here's the guide for env](/selfhosted/setup-env).

Once done, run `npm run build` inside both `/app` and `/backend`

### Step 4. Make sure everything is installed

Check for this:

- Is your nginx configured to serve static content from `/app/dist`
- Make sure nginx has a reverse proxy setup for localhost:2000 (2000 is the default port for the backend)
- Make sure certbot is setup(optional, for ssl)
- Install pm2 and make sure it has started running

### Step 5. Create your account

Once everything is setup, open your frontend(url depends on how you've setup nginx to serve the app/dist folder)

The onboarding process should startup. Follow the steps here and create your account.

Once created, you should be able to track events.

## Security

Both these guides should get you up and runnings, however we recommend:

- You install fail2ban and configure it
- Make sure your server has ssh key auth and not password auth
- Firewall has been setup and works
- Make sure either mysql doesn't have internet access(via firewall) or the default root user cannot be accessed via password auth
- Configure ssh to work on a non-default port

These steps are a bit overkill if you're using Tune as a internal tool, but we recommend doing this for complete peace of mind.
