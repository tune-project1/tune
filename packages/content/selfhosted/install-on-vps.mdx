# Install on your VPS server

For under $10 p/m you can host Tune in a rock-solid environment.

Here's how.

## Step 1. Setup a VPS server

We recommend Hetzner for the most bang-for-your-buck.

Alternatives like Digital Ocean, OVHCloud, Linode, Vultr etc are also good.

## Step 2. Install requirements

You'll need to have nginx installed and configured.

You'll also need a domain name that's linked to your server. A subdomain is also fine.

The application itself requires:

- nodejs 18.x minimum
- mysql 8.x

Install these and make sure nodejs and mysql service* is running.

## Step 3. Install application

Install by either:

Running the script on our [homepage](https://tune).

or,

Running `git clone https://github.com/tune-co/tune.git` (you'll need git to be installed on your server)

or,

Or download the zip package of the application from https://github.com/tune-co/tune and upload it to your server. Then unzip it.

## Step 4. Configure the application

Do this only if you aren't going with the first installation option.

- Go to the application folder, then to /backend and create a `.env` file.
- Fill the .env file with your details(I've outlined this at the bottom of this page**)
- Then run `npm run build`.
- Then run `npm run start`. If you've installed pm2, run `pm2 start index.js` instead.
- Now go back one folder and go to /app
- Create a `.env` file here. Fill in the .env file with your details(I've outlined this at the bottom of the page)
- Then run `npm run build`.

## Step 5. Configuring nginx

You'll need to create two sites. One for the backend and one for the app(static spa)

By default, backend runs on port 2000. Create a reverse proxy on nginx for port 80 to port 2000

For the app, configure nginx to serve /app/dist folder.

## Step 6. Create your account

Once everything is setup, open your frontend(url depends on how you've setup nginx to serve the app/dist folder)

The onboarding process should startup. Follow the steps here and create your account.

Once created, you should be able to track events.

#### \*Configuring mysql

Make sure you have created a database and assigned a user to the database.

Get the connection string ready.

#### \*\*Env for backend

**Vapid**

Generate Vapid details from [vapidkeys](https://vapidkeys.com/)

Then replace VAPID_EMAIL, VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY and VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY with those details.

Vapid details are optional but we recommend setting them for push notifications.

**Api url**
Set this to the url of your backend, eg: https://ops-api.mydomain.com

**App url**
Set this to the url of your app, eg: https://ops.mydomain.com

**Port**
By default, PORT is 2000. But feel free to change it to another one.

**Secret**
Enter a random string in the SECRET.


<Code lang="bash" client:load>
	```
	DATABASE_URL="mysql_connection_string"

VAPID_EMAIL="mailto:shashwat.amin@yahoo.com"
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="BP3td0Ocfd62J-Ggu7ma4SzWIwd5auBSG2rYD4K1uYOU1Q_LfVEKh9oYQqRLx6IITBHTIObZvAzXOJEzAmRGaoU"
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="XAi5fu38VfY_Nm7JssLDxrpdHVRUPjtugWAlAqakKp4"

API_URL=""

APP_URL=""

NODE_ENV="production"

PORT="2000"
SECRET=""
	```
</Code>

You don't need to modify the rest
