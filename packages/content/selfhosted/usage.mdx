### Installing Tune on mobile

There are some benefits to installing Tune on your phone:

- Receive push notifications
- View and manage events from your phone

This makes it a very handy tool for managing your product on the go.

To install Ops on mobile, you'll need to 'Add to Home Screen'.

Once you do this, login to your account and it will work like a webapp.

There are a few goodies here. For instance, you can pull-from-top to refresh current events.

### Setting up push notifications

For this to work, you'll need to setup VAPID env vars.

Once that's done

### Debugging server resources

Ops has a handy panel to help you debug how its working.
