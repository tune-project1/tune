# Install locally

Setting up Tune on your local device is extremely easy.

First, make sure nodejs 18.x and mysql 8.x is running

1. Git clone `https://github.com/tune-co/tune.git`
2. cd to the project folder, then go to `/backend` folder
3. Then create a .env file in the folder and fill in DATABASE_URL and SECRET:
```
DATABASE_URL="CONNECTION_STRING_OF_MYSQL" #enter your database url
SECRET="kjgabskjgbadkljg" #enter a random string
```
4. Then run `npm run build`
5. Then run `npm run start`. By default the server starts on port 2000. Go to localhost:2000 and you should see OK.
6. Then go to `../app` and run `npm run build` and then `npm run preview`
7. Go to localhost:8080 and start the onboarding process

Onboarding process:
<video width="100%" height="400px" controls>
  <source src="/tune-open-source-onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
