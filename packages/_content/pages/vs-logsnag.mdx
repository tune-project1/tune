Logsnag is an event tracking tool, but it serves two purposes:

- Event notifications
- Product analytics

While both are integrated, our comparison focuses on the event notification side, where Tune shares similarities.

## Feature differences

With Logsnag, you can push events and you'll receive notifications. **That's all.**

Tune answers the next logical step - What can you do with these events?

With Tune, not only can you receive event notifications, you can also send json, structured content, image urls and more.

Want to send structured events to better understand complex situations? We have an expressive api to give structure to your logs:

<Item client:only 
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Env",
        content: "production",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "mailchimp working",
        content: "true",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "stripe connected",
        content: "true",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Want to trigger something on your server through events? Tune has actions.

<Item client:only 
  initialExpand="true"
  item={{
    name: "User unsubscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "☹️",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Email",
        content: "mick@mickgordon.com",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Usage",
        content: "122 bookmarks created",
      },
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send feedback email",
      },
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send pullback email",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Want to understand contextual logs? We have that too. Tune has a *extremely expressive* API.

By contrast, Logsnag has a very basic API to show metadata.

### Test events

Tune supports test events by default. Use test events to test out your integration.

Logsnag doesn't have anything similar.

## Side-by-side UI differences

I believe Logsnag and Tune to have really slick interfaces in their own way.

Here's logsnag's UI on mobile. And Tune's UI on the other side.

They are both easy on the eyes and functional.

## Philosophical differences

Logsnag's main modus operandi is delivering pretty product analytics. This is a great problem to solve as most people find Mixpanel, Posthog, etc too complex. And truth to be told, they haven't really working on the notifications side of things for a long time.

Tune is here to solve tune issues for SaaS businesses. This puts us in a very specific domain category. Read our [pitch](https://tune/pitch) to know more.

## Future prospects

Logsnag hasn't received any significant update in over a year.

![Logsnag no update](/images/vs-logsnag/logsnag-no-update.png "Logsnag no update")

Tune is being worked on around the clock. While this is understandable since Tune is a new product, Swipekit my previous SaaS is still receiving updates.

**Note:** We're never going in the product analytics direction.

If you're signing up expecting product analytics, this is the wrong product for you and there are better alternatives out there.

## Pricing

Logsnag has a traditional tiered pricing. Tune has a pay-as-you-go pricing.

Tune wins out at three different levels.

1. Since there are no pricing tiers, you don't need to guesstimate which plan you might want to pick. There is one standard pricing - $x.xxx per event per month.
2. This is great for early stage companies since what you're paying is directly correlated with your usage. With Logsnag, you might be generating x no of events but you still pay the full price of their tier, whichever one you're on.
3. We have a test mode which is free of charge. This is great when you're integrating our product and don't want to rack up bills just because you're testing us out.
Logsnag doesn't have this.

Let's be honest here, if you're a early stage bootstrapped company, you want to save as much money as you can. Since you won't be generating a ton of events, you'll be paying a few dollars every month at most. At that stage, a dollar saved is a dollar earned.

To put it bluntly, **you're better off with us.**

## Final thoughts

I hope this was a compelling pitch for using Tune for event logging.

To be honest - I've used Logsnag and have paid for it in the past. I believe it is a great tool in its own right but they simply don't have a solid offer.

For product analytics, we were with Logsnag but have moved to Posthog as it was better in almost every regard.
