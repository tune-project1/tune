Use Tune to track known errors.

Known errors are not critical errors;eg they won't stop your server. But logging them can be useful for debugging and taking action on critical issues.

For instance, at Swipekit we run a server to scrape Ads. Scraping is a inheritedly grey area job. So we send a event with notification whenever there's a known error in the scraping job.


<CodeWrap client:only>
<div slot="default">
<Item client:only
  item={{
    name: "scraping error",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    type : "rows",
    content : [
      {
        label : 'Ad ID',
        content : '178732529353'
      },
    ]
  }}
></Item>

const e = {

      buttonText : 'Press me'
