# Setup Push Notifications

The best thing about Tune self-hosted is being able to view your events on your mobile and receiving push notifications for them.

To set this up you'll need:

1. SSL connection
2. Vapid keys
3. Enable PWA mode
4. Enable notifications inside your account

Here's how to set this all up:

## 1. Setup SSL

First thing you need is to setup SSL connection from your instance to your domain. If you don't know how to do this, don't worry the [VPS setup guide](http://localhost:3000/selfhosted/install-on-vps) takes care of this.

## 2. Setup Vapid keys

You'll need to generate vapid keys. These are a pair of public and private keys. You can generate them from [here](https://www.attheminute.com/au/vapid-key-generator) or via the [web-push](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) npm package.

You'll also need a valid email address in this format: `mailto:abc@domain.com`

Now you need to set these 3 things up as env vars inside your backend's env file like this:

<Code lang="bash" client:load>

```
VAPID_EMAIL="mailto:email@domain.com"
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="BP3td0Ocfd62J-Ggu9ma4SzWIwd5auBDG2rYD4K1uYOU1Q_LfVEKh9oYQqRLx6IITBHTIObZvAzXOJEzAmRGaoA"
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="XAi7fu38VfY_Nm7JssLDxrpdHVRUPjtugWAlAqakKp1"
```
</Code>

And then add this env var to your app's .env:
<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
VITE_PUSH_SERVER_KEY="BP3td0Ocfd62J-Ggu9ma4SzWIwd5auBDG2rYD4K1uYOU1Q_LfVEKh9oYQqRLx6IITBHTIObZvAzXOJEzAmRGaoA" // vapid public key
```
</Code>

Then run `npm run build` inside app. This will set the env var inside the app.

And then run `pm2 restart 0` to restart the backend.

If you're using docker image, you just need to redeploy after adding env vars.

## 3. Enable PWA mode

Pwa means Progressive Web App. Without this, you won't be able to receive push notifications. On desktops, this is not necessary but you install 'install' PWA at least once.

### Enabling PWA on mobile

On iOS safari, open up your Tune instance

Then click on the middle arrow button in the center of the navbar.

Then click on 'Add to homescreen'

Login and proceed to profile/push notifications (click on your avatar in the bottom nav menu)

Here, it should say PWA enabled.

### Enabling PWA on desktop

Open your Tune instance in Chrome or Firefox(Safari isn't fully tested right now).

Click on the the arrow icon to the right of the URL bar. This will 'install' it as a desktop app.

Now you can use Tune like this. But if you don't want to, that's fine just close the desktop app.

Now login and proceed to profile/push notifications and it should say PWA is enabled.

## Enabling notifications

Now all you need to do is to click the blue "Allow notifications" button inside profile/push notifications.

If a popup doesn't open up asking for enabling notifications, check the URL bar for a "notifications blocked" label.

Click on that and enable notifications.

That's all you need to setup notifications. Once setup, you can test this by clicking on the "send test notification button".
