# Chapter 4. Workflow

Here's a quick primer on integrating Tune into your workflow.

Step 1. Mark unimportant events with muted = true.
These events won't show up in the list by default unless you click the unmute button on the right side of the search bar.

These events are the ones you don't necessarily need to view on a daily basis but its good to track them for record keeping.

Step 2. Only mark important events as notify = true
As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn't receive more than 10 notify events per day. Any more and you'll become desensitized to these events or stop paying attention to them.

Step 3. At the end of your day, review your major events from the last few hours. These are all events excepted the muted ones. Doing this at least once every day will help you gain a better understanding of what's happening in your business.
