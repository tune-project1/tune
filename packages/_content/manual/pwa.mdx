# Chapter 6. PWA mode

On mobile, ops is meant to run as progressive web app(pwa). This has a few benefits:

- Receive push notifications
- Looks and feels like a real app
- Cannot be dismissed/controlled by Safari

**Why run as a pwa?**

Ops is meant to be used on the fly. Enjoy the utter satisfaction of controlling your backend as you go around doing your daily tasks:

- Extend someone's trial while waiting at a red light
- Ban someone while in the gym
- Activate a user when playing forza

PWA makes all this possible.

### How to enable PWA mode

**For iOS**

You need to make sure you're on iOS 16.4. Most iPhones are these days but if you aren't, its worth upgrading your version.

To enable PWA, simply open up app.tune inside Safari and log in. Once logged in, a prompt will appear letting you know how to install Tune as a PWA.

In case you missed that prompt, here are the basic steps:

- Click on the middle icon inside the bottom nav of mobile safari.
- Scroll down and click on "Add to Home Screen"
- In the next screen, press "done"

That's all. From now on, clicking on the ops app icon will make it behaves exactly like a mobile app.

**For Android**
