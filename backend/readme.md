## Project structure

- Components house routes, models and logic functions. They are grouped by functionality, eg api, user, workspace, etc.
- lib contains useful code snippets
- models is nearly defunct but might be useful later on
- prisma contains prisma and clickhouse sql migrations
- private contains temporarily files that might be generated by the backend but not needed.
- public contains files that are exposed by the router for public viewing(eg, logos, banners, etc). Used as filestorage if r2 isn't specified
- services contain self-contained logic bits, eg email(handles email sending), storage(handles file storage), etc.
- test is temporarily for now
