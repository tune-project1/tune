		<Accordion client:load>
			<div slot="title">
				How is this different than Posthog, Mixpanel, etc?
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					These are event analytics tools, Tune is a event tracker tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike event analytics tools that show macro trends (e.g., monthly signups), Tune is an event tracker that notifies you when a critical event happens and shows you micro-level details (e.g., a specific userâ€™s events).
				</p>
			</div>
		</Accordion>

		<Accordion client:only="vue">
			<div slot="title">
				How is this different than ntfy.sh, Mynotifier, Logsnag, etc?
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					Tune is purpose built for developers / tech products.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Arguably better UI/UX, especially on mobile.
					</li>
					<li>
						Expressive API. Send json logs, image urls and more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/api/actions">Action buttons</a> and <a href="/api/context">Contexts</a> are our two differentiator features.
					</li>
					<li>
						Open source version is coming soon.
					</li>
					<li>
						Long term vision is to be a control center for your product.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As for Logsnag, we have a <a href="/vs-logsnag">detailed breakdown of our differences here.</a>
				</p>

		<Accordion client:only>
			<div slot="title">
				I can't be arsed integrating this in my product. It will take a lot of time!
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
				All tools in this category have the same problem - takes ages to setup.
				</p>
				<p>
					So we made a <a href="/playground">playground area</a> where you can literally copy paste code and drop it in your product!<br />This will get you up and running in like an hour.
				</p>
			</div>
		</Accordion>

		<Accordion client:load>
			<div slot="title">
				You don't have a SDK for my language/framework.
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					We thought of that too!
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Tune is a brand new product, SDKs are limited, but weâ€™ve got wrappers for most popular languages.
				</p>
			</div>
		</Accordion>

		<!-- <Accordion client:load>
			<div slot="title">
				What's the pricing like?
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					We have a pay-as-you-go pricing and its $0.001 per event.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under 1,000 events? It's free. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</Accordion> -->

		<!-- <Accordion client:only>
			<div slot="title">
				What if my usage goes up? I'm building a SaaS and by next year I'll be tracking 100,000 events!
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					Don't worry, we have volume pricing baked in! So at 100,000 events you'll be charged $55.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's our <a href="/pricing">pricing calculator</a>.

		<Accordion client:only>
			<div slot="title">
				I'm in. But I want to know who else is using this?
			</div>
			<div slot="body">
				<p>
					Tune is very new, and as such we don't have any major customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					However Tune was created to control and manage <a href="https://swipekit.app" target="_blank">Swipekit</a> remotely because its founder was sick of taking their laptop around everywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Swipekit literally runs on Tune. This is the biggest customer we have for now.
