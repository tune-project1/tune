              <p>
                10,000 free events are one time only. Once you track 10,000 events, you will be
                asked to enter your credit card details.

              <p>No you don't. You can simply sign up and start tracking events right away.</p>
              <p>We will ask for your card details once you track over 10,000 events.</p>

            </template>
            <template #body>
              <p>
                If you don't enter your card details after your free events are up, you will be
                given 5 day as a grace period to enter your card details.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you still haven't entered your card details, your account will be deactivated.

            <template #body>
              <p>
                Billing happens on the 1st of every month. So if you enter your card details, you
                won't be charged right away, you will be charged on the 1st of next month for the
                events accumulated for the previous month.

            <template #body>
              <p>Tune is planned to be open source in the near future.</p>
              <p>
                Right now, there is still a lot of work to be done, but once the code is stable, we
                will make our repo open-source and add guides for self-hosting.

              <p>Events are stored for at least 1 year.</p>
              <p>
                Since Tune is a brand new product, we haven't decided timelines for longer
                term retention.
