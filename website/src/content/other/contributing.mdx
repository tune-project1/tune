# Contributing

Before you begin, know three things:

- Read our [vision](/other/vision) document. This serves as a high level overview of what Tune aims to be. Any contribution that pushes Tune onto its desired direction is welcome.
- This is very much a “benevolent dictator” kind of a project. No design-by-commitee here.
- If you want to contribute, create a Github issue first and ask if help is wanted in x area. Wait for my confirmation. IF you don’t do this and submit a push request, it most likely won’t be accepted.
