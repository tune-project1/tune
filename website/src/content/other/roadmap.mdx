- Be able to copy unique link to events.
- Push notifications are fully functional for self-hosters.
- Self-hosters can easily host on various platforms like Digital Ocean with a few clicks.
- Mysql event store is stress tested to 1 million events.
- Basic security protocols around uploads, logins and signups.
- Commercial part of Ops is ready and can receive payments. 

I'm aiming for a launch around June of this year.
