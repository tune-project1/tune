# Vision

Tune is a simple event tracker right now, but its long term destiny is to help founders manage their product and help them free up their time that is normally spend on tune issues.

This includes things like:

- Being able to understand their business metrics
- Getting notified of critical events
- Be able to view and manage their users remotely

This roadmap is merely a guideline and not set in stone. To realize this will take years.

 I’m mentally committed and I’m going to spend at least a decade of my life realizing this.

Beyond this vision, there are some constraints:

- Functional open-source. Anyone with basic programming knowledge should be able to get an Tune instance up and running within minutes.
- Robust & reliable. Too many projects, especially in the javascript world break apart after a few upgrades. We don’t want that. Migrations should be painless and there should always be a way to backup your data. This philosophy extends inside the product too.
- Insane focus on the user interface. We want people absolutely not familiar with business ops to be able to use the heck out of Tune.
- Serve for the masses. Too many products start serving for the low market and end up exclusively serving high end enterprise customers. We don’t want to do that.
- No VC money. That’s a one-way road to enshittification.
