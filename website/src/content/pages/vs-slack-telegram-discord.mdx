# Tune vs Slack/Telegram/Discord

## Basics

Slack, Telegram, Discord and other chat applications are used by businesses to keep track of tune events.

While they get the job done, there are many downsides to using these tools vs using a dedicated tool such as Tune.

Here's a comparision of various use cases.

## Monitoring basic tune events

Say you want to receive a message whenever your server starts, or a user pays for your product.
Here's how it might look like inside Tune:

<Item
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Env",
        content: "production",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "mailchimp working",
        content: "true",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "stripe connected",
        content: "true",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

You can see how structured events look like inside Tune.
With chat apps you can do the same thing, abit in different ways.

All popular chat apps have expressive APIs around structured events.

## Interactive events

Say you got a notification for an event and you want to have a button in the event which can trigger a webhook?
This can be done inside Tune

<Item
  item={{
    name: "User unsubscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "☹️",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Email",
        content: "mick@mickgordon.com",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Usage",
        content: "122 bookmarks created",
      },
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send feedback email",
      },
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send pullback email",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

This is how a interactive event looks like inside Tune. We call the buttons 'actions'.

## Why pick Tune

- Dedicated for Tune events. Every single bit in the UI from the date/times to the paddings have been adjusted to help you view events quickly. It looks great on mobiles and is the perfect companion for viewing events on the go.
- Robust actions. Tune is the only one in this space to fully support atomic actions such as deleting records, setting flags on records, etc. Slack and other chat apps have very limited abilites around this topic.
- Reduces noise in your channels. A lot of integrations contribute to unnecessary notifications in your chat apps. Tune is a dedicated event tracker for these bits.

Couple of things:

- Tune is a developer tool, meaning you'll need to get a engineer to integrate our tool in your product
