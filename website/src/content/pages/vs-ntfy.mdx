Logsnag is a event tracking tool.

While we solve different problems, we have one thing in common - event tracking.

With Logsnag, we need to make a distinction. Logsnag is two tools in one.

1. Logsnag the event notification tool.
2. Logsnag the product analytics tool.

While they are tied in hand-to-hand, we share similarities with the event notifications tool and hence this comparision will focus on that.

## Feature differences

With Logsnag, you can push events and you'll receive notifications. That's all.

Tune answers the next logical step - What can you do with these events?

With Tune, not only can you receive event notifications, you can also pass structured events to understand complex events:

With Tune, not only can you receive event notifications.

Want to send structured events to better understand complex situations? We have an expressive api to give structure to your logs:

<Item
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Env",
        content: "production",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "mailchimp working",
        content: "true",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "stripe connected",
        content: "true",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Want to trigger something on your server through events? Tune has actions.

<Item
  item={{
    name: "User unsubscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "☹️",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Email",
        content: "mick@mickgordon.com",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "Usage",
        content: "122 bookmarks created",
      },
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send feedback email",
      },
      {
        url: "https://xyz.com",
        buttonText: "Send pullback email",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Want to understand contextual logs? We have that too.

## Side-by-side differences

I believe Logsnag and Tune to have really slick interfaces in their own way.

Here's logsnag's UI on mobile.

And here's tunes's UI.

They are both easy on the eyes and functional.

## Philosophical differences

Logsnag's main modus operandi is delivering pretty product analytics. This is a great problem to solve as most people find Mixpanel, Posthog, etc too complex. And truth to be told, they haven't really working on the notifications side of things for a long time.

Tune is here to solve tune issues for SaaS businesses. This puts us in a very specific domain category.

## Pricing

Logsnag has a traditional tiered pricing. Tune has a pay-as-you-go pricing.

Tune wins out at three different levels.

1. Since there are no pricing tiers, you don't need to guesstimate which plan you might want to pick. There is one standard pricing - $x.xxx per event per month.
2. This is great for early stage companies since what you're paying is directly correlated with your usage. With Logsnag, you might be generating x no of events but you still pay the full price of their tier, whichever one you're on.
3. We have a test mode which is free of charge. This is great when you're integrating our product and don't want to rack up bills just because you're testing us out.
Logsnag doesn't have this.

Logsnag wins on one level:

1. On a per event basis, they are cheaper than us.

Let's be honest here, if you're a early stage bootstrapped company, you want to save as much money as you can. Since you won't be generating a ton of events, you'll be paying a few dollars every month at most. At that stage, a dollar saved is a dollar earned.

To put it bluntly, you're better off with us.

## Final thoughts

I hope this was a compelling pitch for using Tune for event logging.

To be clear - I've used Logsnag and have paid for it in the past. I believe it is a great tool in its own right but they simply don't have a solid offer. For product analytics, we were with Logsnag but have moved to Posthog as it was better in almost every regard.

Lastly, if you like our offering, feel free to give us a try.
