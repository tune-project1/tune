PWA means progressive web app. Running Tune under this mode alters its functionality:

- When PWA is enabled on your browser, you can run it as a desktop app.
- When PWA is enabled on your phone, you can run it as a native app.

Specifically for mobile there are a few benefits:

- Receive push notifications
- Looks and feels like a real app
- Cannot be dismissed by Safari

**Why run as a PWA?**

Ops is meant to be used on the fly. Enjoy the utter satisfaction of controlling your backend as you go around doing your daily tasks:

- Extend someone's trial while waiting at a red light
- Ban someone while in the gym
- Activate a user when playing forza

PWA makes all this possible.

### How to enable PWA mode

**For desktop**

- Open up app.tune
- Click on the install icon on the right side of the url baseUrl
- That's it. Tune should open up as a desktop app.

You can still continue using it as a webapp if you wish.

**For iOS**

You need to make sure you're on iOS 16.4. Most iPhones are these days but if you aren't, its worth upgrading your version.

To enable PWA, simply open up app.tune inside Safari and log in. Once logged in, a prompt will appear letting you know how to install Tune as a PWA.

In case you missed that prompt, here are the basic steps:

- Click on the middle icon inside the bottom nav of mobile safari.
- Scroll down and click on "Add to Home Screen"
- In the next screen, press "done"

That's all. From now on, clicking on the ops app icon will make it behaves exactly like a mobile app.

**For Android**
