PWA(progressive web app) is a mode under which Tune can run:

- When PWA is enabled on your browser, you can run it as a desktop app.
- When PWA is enabled on your phone, you can run it as a native app.

For mobile there are a few extra benefits:

- Receive push notifications
- Looks and feels like a real app
- Cannot be dismissed by Safari

**Why run as a PWA?**

Ops is meant to be used on the fly. Enjoy the utter satisfaction of controlling your backend as you go around doing your daily tasks:

- Extend someone's trial while waiting at a red light
- Ban someone while in the gym
- Activate a user when playing forza

PWA makes all this possible!

### How to enable PWA mode

**For desktop**

- Open up app.tune
- Click on the install icon on the right side of the url baseUrl
- That's it. Tune should open up as a desktop app.

You can still continue using it as a webapp if you wish.

**For iOS**

You need to make sure you're on iOS 16.4. Most iPhones are these days but if you aren't, its worth upgrading your version.

Then follow these steps:

- Click on the middle icon inside the bottom nav of mobile safari.
- Scroll down and click on "Add to Home Screen"
- In the next screen, press "done"

That's all. From now on, clicking on the ops app icon will make it behaves exactly like a mobile app.

**For Android**
