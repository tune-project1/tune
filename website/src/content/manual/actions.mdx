# Chapter 3. Actions

Up till now, you can understand what's happening in your product. But what if you want to trigger something with an event?

With Actions, you can add buttons to events. When pressed, they will send a webhook to your server and make it trigger things.

Here are some common scenarios for Actions:

- Ban users who signup with throwaway emails
- Activate users manually
- Send emails to users at various stages

And so on.

Here are some scenarios where actions can really help ease tune workload in your product.

**Send email to user after their trial ends, allowing them to extend their trial**

We've seen that when certain users are allowed to extend their trial based on some heuristic, they tend to usually convert into a paying user.

The heuristic depends on your product. A basic heuristic would be usage. If a user hasn't used much of your product, there's no point allowing them to extend their trial.
But if someone has used the heck out of your product, they might become paying customers after a bit more of usage.

There's a certain psychological factor behind this too but that's a discussion for another day.

<Item
  item={{
    name: "user trial ended",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        label: "Bookmarks",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        type: "json",
        label: "form",
        content: {
          find_us: "Google",
          works_in: "Marketing",
        },
      },
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        buttonText: "Extend trial?",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Another scenario is where a user unsubscribes and you want to retain them. You can trigger ops to send an email asking them for feedback or ask them what would it take to retain them.
In this scenario, you can add multiple actions which can trigger various emails.

<Item
  item={{
    name: "user unsubscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        label: "Bookmarks",
        content: 422,
      },
      {
        type: "json",
        label: "form",
        content: {
          find_us: "Google",
          works_in: "Marketing",
        },
      },
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        buttonText: "Ask for feedback",
      },
      {
        buttonText: "Ask to retain #1",
      },
      {
        buttonText: "Ask to retain #2",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

## Setting up your server for actions

Instead of creating multiple routes for each action, its better to create one route for all actions.

This will keep your code tidier and make managing actions easier.

<Code client:only>
```
// This is bad
app.post('/api/action1', (req, res) => {
})

app.post('/api/action2', (req, res) => {
})

app.post('/api/action3', (req, res) => {
})
```
</Code>

<Code client:only>
```
// Do this instead

app.post('/api/action', (req, res) => {
  let type = req.body.action.type;

  if(type === 'action1') {
    await controller.action1;
  }

  if(type === 'action2') {
    await controller.action2;
  }

  if(type === 'action3') {
    await controller.action3;
  }
})
```
</Code>
