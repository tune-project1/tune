# Chapter 3. Setup

You can track a gazillion events with ops.

However a far better strategy is by writing down all your tune pain points in a notepad.

If you're just starting to build a SaaS business for instance, you might've not dealt with tune issues so here are some:

- When your server starts, you want to know what's the node_env, database_url, and other variables.
- You want to understand who's signing up. I need to know their \*email, name and other bits
- You need to know if new signups have either finished their onboarding process and/or they have used at least a bit of the product.
- You want to know when user's trial ends. When this happens I need to know how much \*\*resources they consumed/processed.
- You need to know when someone pays for my product.

  \*You can also include form data. For instance, during your onboarding process ask your user how did they found your
  product. Then you can pass this information to ops.

  \**Resources could be anything. For instance, if you're building a bookmarking app, a resource could be a bookmark. If
  you're building an AI tool, a resource could be 1 api call to openAI; and so on.

Once you've compiled a list of issues, next step is to send events to use ops to solve these issues.

1. **When your server starts, you want to know what's the node_env, and other variables.**

Send a event to ops on on server start. Pass in important env vars(don't add them all or it will look very confusing)

<Item client:only
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "ENV",
        content: "production",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "DATABASE_URL",
        content: "mysql://user:213243tgfg435@111.222.333.444",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "mailchimp working",
        content: "true",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        label: "stripe connected",
        content: "true",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

2. **You want to understand who's signing up. You need to know their \*email, name and other bits**

Send a event to ops when someone signs up. Pass all important user data + any form data you've collected from them.

<Item client:only
  item={{
    name: "user signup",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        type: "json",
        label: "form",
        content: {
          find_us: "Google",
          works_in: "Marketing",
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

3. **You need to know if new signups have either finished their onboarding process and/or they have used at least a bit of the product.**

Send a event to ops when someone signs up. Pass all important user data + any form data you've collected from them.

<Item client:only 
  item={{
    name: "user onboarded",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        label: "Bookmarks",
        content: 7,
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

Hint: You can also combine similar events using [contexts](/api/contexts). Example:

<Item client:only
  item={{
    name: "user signup",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        type: "json",
        label: "form",
        content: {
          find_us: "Google",
          works_in: "Marketing",
        },
      },
    ],
    contexts: [
      {
        name: "user activated",
        createdAt: "2021-03-03",
        avatar: "🤖",
      },
      {
        name: "user onboarded",
        createdAt: "2021-03-03",
        avatar: "🤖",
      },
    ],
  }}
></Item>

4. **You want to know when user's trial ends. When this happens you need to know how much resources they consumed/processed.**

Send a event when a user's trial finishes. Pass key metrics in the event. Ideally, pass actions here to ask high value users whether they would like to extend their trial, or ask for a review in exchange for a trial extension.
<Item client:only
  item={{
    name: "user trial ended",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "🤖",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "ID",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
      {
        label: "Email",
        content: "shash@tune",
      },
      {
        label: "Bookmarks",
        content: 122,
      },
      {
        type: "json",
        label: "form",
        content: {
          find_us: "Google",
          works_in: "Marketing",
        },
      },
    ],
    actions : [
      {
        buttonText : 'Extend trial',
        key : 'extend_trial',
        url : '#'
      },
      {
        buttonText : 'Ask for review',
        key : 'ask_for_review',
        url : '#'
      }
    ]
  }}
></Item>
