# Conventions

Ops is all about customization. No two businesses are same, and hence ops comes many options.
However, in the beginning, its best to stick to some conventions.

1. **Always use descriptive avatars.**

If no avatar is passed, a tilde(~) symbol will show up.

<Item
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
  }}
></Item>

Instead, use descriptive avatars. Use a robot for server side stuff, normal emojis to convey user actions and emotions, etc.

<Item
  item={{
    name: "server started",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
  }}
></Item>

<Item
  item={{
    name: "User signed up",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ˜€",
  }}
></Item>
<Item
  item={{
    name: "user subscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤‘",
  }}
></Item>
<Item
  item={{
    name: "user unsubscribed",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ˜¢",
  }}
></Item>

2. **Make sure your event names don't have user properties**

This is wrong:

<Item
  item={{
    name: "Shash signed up",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ˜€",
  }}
></Item>

Do this instead:

<Item
  item={{
    name: "user signed up",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    avatar: "ðŸ˜€",
    type: "rows",
    content: [
      {
        label: "Name",
        content: "Shash",
      },
    ],
  }}
>
  {" "}
</Item>

Event names should be specific. If you add a user property or some other dynamic text inside the event name, it will become a lot harder to search for events.

Also we're developing event aggregrations and not following this pattern means you won't be able to aggregrate events in the near future, eg: x number of "user signed up" events happened.

3. **Use common conventions for event names**

Over time, you'll have many events. This will affect everything including how quickly you can search through events, understand them and much more.

Keep common conventions for events. Here are a few examples:

- Denote cron jobs by `cron: {name of the cronjob}`
- Append user before any user specific events `user: {name of event}` OR `user ${name of event}`
- Append server before any server specific event, `server: started` OR `server: startup failed`
