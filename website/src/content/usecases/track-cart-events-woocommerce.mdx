## Why Track Cart Events in WooCommerce

Tracking cart events helps you understand user behavior before checkout. You can see when users add or remove items.

This data can highlight friction points and reduce cart abandonment. For example, if many users remove high-priced items, you might offer discounts.

## Tune for Ecommerce Event Tracking

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform that captures actions like cart updates. You can send events from WooCommerce to see live data in one dashboard.

## Setup Tune for WooCommerce

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project for your WooCommerce store.
3. Copy the API key from your project settings.

## Integrate WooCommerce with Tune

```php
<?php
// Replace with your actual API key
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'Cart Updated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
  'content' => 'User updated cart with 3 items totaling $150.00',
  'properties' => [
    'cart_id' => 456,
    'items_count' => 3,
    'total' => 150.00
  ],
  'user_id' => 789
];

// Send the event to Tune API
$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

The code above sends a cart updated event with details such as cart ID, item count, and total value to Tune.
