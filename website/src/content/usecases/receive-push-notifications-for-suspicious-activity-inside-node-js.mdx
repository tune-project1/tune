## What is suspicious activity detection in Node.js

Receiving alerts for odd behavior in your Node.js app helps you catch security issues early.
Imagine a hacker trying multiple login attempts.
Getting push notifications lets you act fast and protect user data.

### Tracking suspicious activity with Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool.
It captures events from any tech product and triggers alerts.
You can define events for suspicious actions and send notifications.

### Setup Tune for your Node.js app

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK: `npm install @tune/sdk`.

### Code example: Sending alerts for suspicious activity

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

// Example 1: Failed login attempts
const payload1 = {
  name: "failed login attempt",
  avatar: "ðŸš¨",
  content: "User John Smith failed to login 5 times"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload1)

// Example 2: Login from unusual location
const payload2 = {
  name: "unusual login location",
  avatar: "ðŸš¨",
  content: "User John Smith logged in from 8.8.8.8, a new location"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload2)

// Example 3: Multiple password reset requests
const payload3 = {
  name: "multiple password reset",
  avatar: "ðŸš¨",
  content: "User John Smith requested password reset 3 times within 5 minutes"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload3)
```

These examples show how to send different suspicious activity events with Tune.

### Conclusion

Tune saves time by handling event ingestion and notifications.
