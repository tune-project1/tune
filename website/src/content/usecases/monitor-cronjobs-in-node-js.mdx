## What is cronjob monitoring in Node.js

If you're using a package like `croner`,  monitoring cronjobs in Node.js helps you catch failures and track performance of scheduled tasks.
For example, you might send daily reports to yourself or clean up data every hour.

If a job fails silently, you lose insights and might miss critical alerts.

### Using Tune to Track Cronjobs

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool for tech products.
You can easily track cronjob events like start, success, and failure.
This helps you spot issues and analyze job runs over time.

### Setting Up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and get your API key from project settings.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:
   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Save your API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPERATIONAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

### Example Code

The code below shows how to send events when a cronjob starts, succeeds, or fails.

Paste this code examples inside your cronjob functions.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY);

// Track job start
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob started",
  avatar: "⏱️",
  content: "Daily report job started by system"
});

// Track job success
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob successful",
  avatar: "✅",
  content: "Daily report job completed in 120 seconds"
});

// Track job failure
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob failed",
  avatar: "❌",
  content: "Daily report job failed due to timeout"
});
```

This example shows how to log different stages of a cronjob.

### Conclusion

Tune can save you time by collecting cronjob events in one dashboard. You avoid manual logging and get real-time alerts for failures.
