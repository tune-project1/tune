## What is cronjob monitoring in Node.js?

Cronjobs are scheduled tasks that run at fixed times or intervals in many applications.
Monitoring cronjobs helps you spot failures, slow runs, or missed schedules.

For example, if you have a daily data backup cronjob, you want to know when it fails or takes too long.
That way you can alert your team and fix issues before data is lost.

## How Tune helps monitor cronjobs

Tune is an event tracking platform you can use to record cronjob runs and errors.
You can send events for each execution, success, or failure.

Tune displays these events in a timeline so you see patterns and catch problems early.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key from the project dashboard.
3. In your Node.js app folder run `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Import and initialize the SDK with your API key in your code.

## Tracking cronjob events

Below are examples of how to send different cronjob events to Tune using Node.js.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

// 1. Success example
const successEvent = {
  name: "cronjob executed",
  avatar: "‚è∞",
  content: "Daily data backup completed in 1500ms"
}
await ops.events.ingest(successEvent)

// 2. Failure example
const failureEvent = {
  name: "cronjob failed",
  avatar: "‚ùå",
  content: "Weekly report generation failed with timeout"
}
await ops.events.ingest(failureEvent)

// 3. Slow run example
const slowEvent = {
  name: "cronjob slow",
  avatar: "üê¢",
  content: "Cleanup task took 4500ms instead of 2000ms"
}
await ops.events.ingest(slowEvent)

// 4. Missed run example
const missedEvent = {
  name: "cronjob missed",
  avatar: "üö®",
  content: "Morning data sync did not run at 03:00"
}
await ops.events.ingest(missedEvent)
```

This code shows how to track a successful run, a failure, a slow execution, and a missed run.
Each event helps you spot issues in your scheduled tasks.

## Conclusion

With Tune you can easily track cronjob executions in Node.js and get a clear view of failures or delays.
It saves time on manual checks and helps you react quickly when jobs misbehave.
