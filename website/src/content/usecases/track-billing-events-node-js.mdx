## What this article covers

Tracking billing events in your Node.js application helps you monitor transactions in real time. You can see when a customer pays, when an invoice is generated, or when a subscription renews. This insight helps you catch failures and improve customer trust.

## What is Tune and how it works

Tune is an open source platform for capturing events from any tech product. It stores your events and shows them in a clean dashboard. You can filter, search, and get alerts on the data that matters.

By sending billing events to Tune, you get a live feed of payments and invoices. You can use it to spot failed charges and analyze revenue trends.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. After you verify your email, log in to get your API key.
3. Copy the key and keep it safe.

You will use this API key in your Node.js app to send events.

## Code examples

The following examples show how to track billing events in Node.js using the Tune SDK.

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

// 1. Record a successful payment
the code:
const paymentPayload = {
  name: "Billing succeeded",
  avatar: "üí∞",
  content: "Invoice #123 paid by John Smith for $49.99"
}
await ops.events.ingest(paymentPayload)

// 2. Record a failed payment
the code:
const failurePayload = {
  name: "Billing failed",
  avatar: "‚ö†Ô∏è",
  content: "Payment failed for invoice #124 for Jane Doe"
}
await ops.events.ingest(failurePayload)

// 3. Record a subscription renewal
the code:
const renewPayload = {
  name: "Subscription renewed",
  avatar: "üîÑ",
  content: "Subscription for Acme Pro plan renewed by John Smith"
}
await ops.events.ingest(renewPayload)
```

Each example sends a billing event with a name, an emoji avatar, and a human readable message. Replace `API_KEY` with your actual key.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to track billing events saves time and reduces manual work. You get all your payment data in one place. You can set up alerts on failed charges and monitor revenue trends.
