## What is viewing user profile data in WooCommerce?

Viewing user profile data in WooCommerce helps you understand customer behavior.

It lets you tailor offers and improve your store.

For example, tracking when a user checks their address or account history can highlight engagement.

## Using Tune to track profile view events

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool.

It lets you log events like profile views in any tech product.

You can record each profile view in WooCommerce to analyze user activity.

## Setting up Tune

2. Create a project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the PHP SDK or prepare HTTP requests.

## Tracking profile view events in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Profile Viewed',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content' => 'Alice Smith viewed her profile data.'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: ' . 'Bearer ' . $apiKey,
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This code sends a User Profile Viewed event to Tune recording the user name and action.
