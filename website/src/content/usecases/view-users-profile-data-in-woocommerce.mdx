## Understanding User Profile Data in WooCommerce

Viewing a user's profile data in your WooCommerce store helps you personalize experiences and troubleshoot account issues.

For example, you may want to log when a customer updates their address or views order history.

### Using Tune to Track Profile Views

Tune is an event tracking platform that captures structured events from any tech product.

You can use Tune to record when users view their profiles in WooCommerce and analyze these events over time.

2. Create a new workspace for your WooCommerce store.
3. Locate your API key in the workspace settings and copy it.

### Tracking Profile Views in WooCommerce

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'Profile View',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
    'content' => 'User John Smith viewed WooCommerce profile',
    'properties' => [
        'user_id' => 123,
        'display_name' => 'John Smith',
        'email' => 'john@example.com'
    ]
];

$response = $ops->events->ingest($payload);
echo 'Event sent with status: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
```

This snippet sends a profile view event to Tune whenever a customer views their WooCommerce profile.
