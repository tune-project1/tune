## What are cart events in PHP

Cart events capture key interactions in your e-commerce PHP app. These include actions like adding an item to the cart, removing it, and completing checkout.

Tracking these events helps you understand user behavior. For example, you can see which products are most often added but not purchased.

With this data, you can optimize your store and boost conversions.

### Using Tune to Track Cart Events

### Setting Up Tune

3. In your project settings, copy the API key.
4. Install the PHP SDK with Composer:

   composer require tune/tune
   ```

5. Add the API key to your environment or config file.

### Code Snippet: Tracking Cart Events in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

// User adds an item to cart
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name'   => 'add_to_cart',
  'avatar' => '🛒',
  'content'=> 'User John Smith added product ID 123 to cart'
]);

// User removes an item from cart
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name'   => 'remove_from_cart',
  'avatar' => '🗑️',
  'content'=> 'User John Smith removed product ID 123 from cart'
]);

// User completes checkout
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name'   => 'checkout',
  'avatar' => '✅',
  'content'=> 'User John Smith completed purchase of order 456'
]);
?>
```

The snippet shows how to send different cart events. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.
