## Why track cart events in PHP?

Tracking cart events helps you understand how users interact with your ecommerce store. It shows which products are popular and where users drop off. This data can boost sales and reduce abandoned carts.

## What is Tune?

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool. It captures events from any application and sends them to a dashboard. You can track cart events in real time and analyze user behavior without complex setup.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and get your API key.
3. Store the API key in a secure place or set it as an environment variable in your PHP app.

## Code example

The following PHP snippet shows how to send an add_to_cart event to Tune.

```php
<?php
$apiKey = getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY') ?: 'YOUR_API_KEY';

$payload = [
    'name' => 'cart updated',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
    'content' => 'John Smith added a new item to the cart',
    'properties' => [
        'event' => 'add_to_cart',
        'product_id' => 456,
        'quantity' => 1
    ]
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This code sends a cart updated event to Tune. You can change the properties to track other cart actions like remove_from_cart or checkout.

## Conclusion

Tune saves you time by handling event ingestion and storage. You get real-time cart data without building a custom solution. Learn more on the [Tune home page](https://tune). Try code snippets in the [Playground](https://tune/playground).
