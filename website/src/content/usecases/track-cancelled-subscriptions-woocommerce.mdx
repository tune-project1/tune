## Why track cancelled subscriptions in WooCommerce

Tracking subscription cancellations helps you understand churn and retain customers.

For example, when a customer stops their plan you can follow up with tailored offers or fix issues.

## What is Tune and how to use it for cancellations

Tune is an open-source tool to capture events in any tech product.

It centralizes logs like subscription cancellations so you can view them in a unified dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

1. Visit [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. Create a new workspace for your WooCommerce store.
3. Copy your API key from the workspace settings.
4. Add the API key to your site configuration or environment file.
5. Install the Tune SDK or set up HTTP requests.

## Code example: WooCommerce cancellation tracking

```php
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_updated', 'track_cancelled_subscription', 10, 3);

function track_cancelled_subscription($subscription, $old_status, $new_status) {
  if ($new_status !== 'cancelled') {
    return;
  }

  $user_name = $subscription->get_billing_first_name() . ' ' . $subscription->get_billing_last_name();

  $payload = [
    'name'    => 'subscription cancelled',
    'avatar'  => '❌',
    'content' => 'Subscription #' . $subscription->get_id() . ' for ' . $user_name . ' was cancelled',
  ];

  $response = wp_remote_post(
    'https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest',
    [
      'headers' => [
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type'  => 'application/json',
      ],
      'body'    => wp_json_encode($payload),
    ]
  );
}
```

This code listens for subscription cancellations in WooCommerce and sends an event to Tune with the subscription ID and customer name.

Capture and view events in one place to respond faster and reduce churn.
