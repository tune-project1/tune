## Understanding Cart Events in SaaS

Cart events refer to user actions around the shopping cart in your SaaS application. Tracking these events helps you see how users add, remove, and purchase items. For example, if many users add items but abandon before checkout, you can optimize the flow to boost conversions.

Monitoring cart events gives insight into drop-off points and user intent. You can send targeted messages or offers to users who abandoned carts.

## Using Tune to Track Cart Events

Tune is an open-source toolkit for capturing events in any tech product. It provides a simple API to ingest and view events in real time.

You can use Tune to track cart events like items added, removed, and purchases. It stores and displays events in a unified dashboard.

## Setting Up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new project and copy the API key.
3. Install the SDK in your application:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Keep your API key handy for initializing the client.

## Code Examples

The following JavaScript examples show how to track different cart events with Tune.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

// 1. Track when a user adds an item to the cart
const payload1 = {
  name: "Cart Item Added",
  avatar: "🛒",
  content: "User Jane Doe added product T-shirt to cart"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload1);

// 2. Track when a user removes an item from the cart
const payload2 = {
  name: "Cart Item Removed",
  avatar: "🗑️",
  content: "User Jane Doe removed product T-shirt from cart"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload2);

// 3. Track when a user views the cart
const payload3 = {
  name: "Cart Viewed",
  avatar: "🛒",
  content: "User Jane Doe viewed their shopping cart"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload3);

// 4. Track when a user completes a purchase
const payload4 = {
  name: "Checkout Completed",
  avatar: "✅",
  content: "User Jane Doe purchased 3 items totaling $75"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload4);
```

These snippets capture key cart interactions. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and user/item details as needed.
