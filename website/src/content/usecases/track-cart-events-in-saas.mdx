## What is cart event tracking in SaaS

Tracking cart events helps you understand how users interact with your product. For example, you can record when a user adds an item to their cart to measure engagement and conversion.

### What is Tune and tracking events

Tune is an open source event tracking tool for any product. It uses a single API to ingest events from your SaaS. You can use it to log cart events and view them in real time.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new workspace for your project.
3. Navigate to settings and copy your API key.
4. Install the SDK in your app with npm or yarn.

### Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

// Add item to cart
const addItemPayload = {
  name: "Item Added to Cart",
  avatar: "âž•",
  content: "jane.doe@example.com added 'Wireless Mouse' (ID: 456) to cart"
};

await ops.events.ingest(addItemPayload);

// Remove item from cart
const removeItemPayload = {
  name: "Item Removed from Cart",
  avatar: "âž–",
  content: "jane.doe@example.com removed 'Wireless Mouse' (ID: 456) from cart"
};

await ops.events.ingest(removeItemPayload);

// Checkout started
const checkoutPayload = {
  name: "Checkout Started",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "jane.doe@example.com started checkout with 3 items"
};

await ops.events.ingest(checkoutPayload);
```

The code above shows how to track adding items, removing items, and starting checkout events in your SaaS.
