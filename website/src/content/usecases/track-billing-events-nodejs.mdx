## What is billing event tracking in Node.js

Tracking billing events in your Node.js app helps you monitor payments, subscriptions, and refunds in real time. For example, you can log when a customer‚Äôs payment succeeds and alert your team on failures.

### Tracking billing events with Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool. You can use it to ingest and view billing events from your app in a single dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

2. In your dashboard, copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your project: `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Keep your API key handy for the code examples below.

### Code examples

The following snippets show how to track different billing events in Node.js using Tune.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  "name": "subscription created",
  "avatar": "üí≥",
  "content": "New subscription for John Smith: Pro Plan."
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example tracks a new subscription event.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  "name": "payment successful",
  "avatar": "‚úÖ",
  "content": "Payment of $20.00 received from Jane Doe."
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example logs a successful payment.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  "name": "refund processed",
  "avatar": "‚Ü©Ô∏è",
  "content": "Refund of $20.00 issued to Jane Doe."
