## Why track profile updates in your SaaS

Tracking changes to user profiles helps you keep clients informed. It can show when a user updates their bio or email. For example, notifying a team lead when a user changes their role can improve security and transparency.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open source service to track events in your tech product. You can use it to send events when a user updates their profile. It then delivers push notifications based on those events.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your project.

## Tracking profile update events

Below are examples of sending profile update events. These snippets use the Node.js SDK.

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "profile update: bio changed",
  avatar: "‚ÑπÔ∏è",
  content: "John Smith updated their bio"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "profile update: email changed",
  avatar: "‚úâÔ∏è",
  content: "Jane Doe changed her email address"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "profile update: avatar changed",
  avatar: "üñºÔ∏è",
  content: "Alex Lee updated their profile picture"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

Each example sends an event that you can use to trigger a push notification when a user updates their profile.

## Conclusion

Using Tune can save you time and avoid building a notification system from scratch. You can track any event, set up rules, and send push alerts with minimal code.
