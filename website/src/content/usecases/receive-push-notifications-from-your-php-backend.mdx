## What is receiving push notifications in PHP

Push notifications let your application send real-time updates to users.
Implementing them in PHP can help you engage users with timely messages.
For example you can send a notification when an order status changes.

### Using Tune for push notifications

Tune is a lightweight event tracking service.
It can record push notification events from any backend.
You can then view these events in a simple dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep the API key safe for your code.

### Code example

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client([
  'base_uri' => 'https://api.tune',
  'headers' => [
    'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
  ],
]);

$payload = [
  'name' => 'Push notification sent',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
  'content' => 'Sent welcome push to user John Smith'
];

$response = $client->post('/v1/events', [
  'json' => $payload,
]);

echo $response->getStatusCode(), "\n";
```

This code sends an event to Tune when a push notification is sent.
It records the event name, icon, and details in the content field.

### Conclusion

Tune can save you time by handling event ingestion.
You can view and filter push notification events in a dashboard.
