## What this article is about

Sending push notifications from your PHP backend helps you keep users engaged as events happen.
For example, you might notify a user when they receive a new message or when a friend comes online.
Tracking these notifications gives you insights into delivery success and user interactions.

## What is Tune

Tune is a simple event-tracking platform. You send structured events about actions in your app or backend.
With Tune you can view a history of events, build alerts, and explore trends.
Use it to record when push notifications are sent and monitor their delivery.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key from the dashboard.
3. In your PHP project, install a HTTP client like cURL or the Tune PHP SDK if available.
4. Keep your API key secure by setting it in an environment variable.

## Code example

```php
<?php
$apiKey = getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY');

$data = [
  'name' => 'push_notification_sent',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ“²',
  'content' => 'Sent a push notification to user Jane Doe'
];

$payload = json_encode($data);

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $payload);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This snippet sends a `push_notification_sent` event to Tune with an emoji and description. It logs when your PHP backend delivers a push notification.

## Conclusion

Tune saves you time by handling event ingestion and storage so you can focus on your application logic.
Youâ€™ll get real-time visibility into your push notifications without building a custom pipeline.
