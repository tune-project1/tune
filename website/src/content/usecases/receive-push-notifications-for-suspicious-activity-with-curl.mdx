# 1. What this article is about

This article explains how you can use cURL to send alerts for suspicious activity to Tune. Alerts help you respond quickly when something looks off.

For example, you might want to know if there are multiple failed login attempts on your platform.

# 2. What is Tune?

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool for tech products. You can use it to track errors, audits, and security events.

By sending events to Tune, you get real-time notifications and a clear event history in one dashboard.

# 3. Setting up Tune

First, sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) with your email.

Once you log in, create a new project. That will give you an API key. Copy the key for the next step.

# 4. Sending events with cURL

Use cURL to post events to Tune. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your key:

```bash
curl https://api.tune/events.ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Suspicious login attempt",
    "avatar": "ðŸš¨",
    "content": "Multiple failed login attempts from IP 203.0.113.45"
  }'
```

This command sends a security event to Tune. You will receive a push notification when Tune ingests the event.

# 5. Conclusion

Using Tune with cURL saves time by letting you send alerts without extra code. You can see events in one place and get notified right away.
