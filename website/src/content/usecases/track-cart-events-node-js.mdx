## What this article is about

Tracking cart events in your Node.js application helps you understand customer behaviour and improve conversions.

For example, you can see when a user adds an item to the cart, removes an item, or starts checkout.

## What is Tune

Tune lets you send custom events from your app to a dashboard in seconds.

You can use it to log cart actions in real time and analyse how users interact with your store.

## Setting up Tune

To get started, sign up at https://app.tune and create a free account.

Once you log in, copy your API key from the workspace settings.

You will use this key in your Node.js code to authenticate event ingestion.

## Code examples

Here are examples for tracking common cart events in a Node.js app.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "item added to cart",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "John Smith added an electric toothbrush (ID: 5678) to cart"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```javascript
// Remove item from cart
const removePayload = {
  name: "item removed from cart",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "Jane Doe removed a running shoe (ID: 1234) from cart"
}

await ops.events.ingest(removePayload)
```

```javascript
// Checkout started
const checkoutPayload = {
  name: "checkout initiated",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "Alice Lee started checkout with 3 items in cart"
}

await ops.events.ingest(checkoutPayload)
```

These snippets show how to send different cart events to Tune. Replace `API_KEY` with your actual key.

## Conclusion

Tracking cart events with Tune saves you time and hassle by giving real-time insights into user behaviour.
