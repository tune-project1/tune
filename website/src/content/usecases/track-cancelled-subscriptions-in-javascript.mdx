# Why track cancelled subscriptions

Tracking subscription cancellations in your JavaScript app helps you understand churn. You can see when and why users leave.

For example, if many users cancel a plan after a specific action, you can improve that part of your product.

# What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool that captures your key product events.

You can send events like subscription cancellations to Tune and view them in real time.

# Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create a team.
2. Copy your API key from the project settings.
3. Install the SDK with `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Initialize the client in your code.

# Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "subscription_cancelled",
  avatar: "ðŸ’”",
  content: "Jane Doe cancelled her Pro Plan subscription.",
  properties: {
    user_id: 12345,
    email: "jane.doe@example.com",
    subscription_id: "sub_67890",
    plan: "Pro Plan"
  }
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This snippet records a subscription cancellation event with user and plan details.
