## What is Tune
Tune is an open-source platform for tracking events in your applications.
It lets you send custom events like disk usage alerts and view them in a dashboard.

## Setting up Tune
1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. After login, get your API key from the workspace settings.
3. Keep the key handy to send events from your code.

## Code example
```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "disk space low",
  avatar: "ðŸ’¾",
  content: "Disk usage at 92% on production server"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```
This code sends a diskspace warning event to Tune with details about the server usage.

## Conclusion
Using Tune saves you time and hassle by handling event tracking and alerts.
