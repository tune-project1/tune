# What is subscription cancellation tracking in WordPress

Tracking cancelled subscriptions helps you understand churn and improve your service. For example, if a user cancels a premium plan on your WooCommerce site, logging that event lets you analyze trends over time.

# Using Tune to track cancellations

Tune is an event-based platform that captures actions in your app. You can send cancellation events to Tune and view them in your dashboard.
