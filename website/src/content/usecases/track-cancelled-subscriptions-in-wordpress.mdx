## Why track cancelled subscriptions

Tracking cancelled subscriptions helps you spot churn. It lets you know why customers leave. You can act fast. You can improve your plans.

For example, if many users cancel a premium plan after one month, you can adjust pricing.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. It collects events from your app. You can view and filter data in real time. You can track any event, like signups, purchases, and cancellations. It helps you understand user behavior.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep the key safe.

## Sending cancellation events in WordPress

Use this code in your theme or plugin. It runs when a WooCommerce subscription is cancelled.

```php
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_cancelled', 'send_cancel_event', 10, 1);

function send_cancel_event($subscription) {
  $api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
  $user = $subscription->get_user()->display_name;
  $plan = $subscription->get_items()[0]->get_name();

  $payload = [
    'name' => 'subscription cancelled',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ”•',
    'content' => "User {$user} cancelled the {$plan} subscription"
  ];

  wp_remote_post('https://api.tune/v1/events', [
    'headers' => [
      'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $api_key,
      'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    ],
    'body' => json_encode($payload),
  ]);
}
```

This code listens for cancellations. It builds a payload. Then it sends the event to Tune.

## Conclusion

Tune can save time tracking cancelled subscriptions. You get real data on churn. You can act on insights.
