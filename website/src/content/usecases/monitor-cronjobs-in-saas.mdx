## What this article is about

Cronjobs run tasks at set intervals in your SaaS product. Monitoring them helps you catch failures, track timings, and ensure smooth operations.

For example, a daily report job might fail silently without alerts. With proper monitoring, you get instant visibility into issues.

## Why use Tune for cronjob monitoring

Tune lets you send structured events whenever your scheduled tasks run. You can log successes, capture failures, and add context like run duration or user ID.

This makes it easy to search, filter, and alert on cronjob events in one place.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key from the dashboard.
3. Install the SDK in your project: `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Keep your API key handy for code integration.

## Tracking cronjob events with code

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

async function runDailyReport() {
  try {
    // ... your cronjob logic ...
    const payload = {
      name: "cronjob completed",
      avatar: "ðŸ•’",
      content: "Daily report job finished for user 123"
    }

    await ops.events.ingest(payload)
  } catch (error) {
    const payload = {
      name: "cronjob failed",
      avatar: "ðŸš¨",
      content: "Daily report job failed with error: timeout"
    }

    await ops.events.ingest(payload)
  }
}

runDailyReport()
```

This code sends a success event when the daily report finishes and an error event if something goes wrong.

## Conclusion

Monitoring cronjobs with Tune saves you time and gives clear insights into scheduled task health. You can set up alerts, filter runs, and spot issues fast.
