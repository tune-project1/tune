## What is billing event tracking in WooCommerce?

Tracking billing events helps you monitor payment flows in your store.  
You can see when invoices are created, paid, or fail.  
For example, you might want to alert your team when a payment fails to follow up.

### Using Tune for billing events

Tune lets you send and view events in a dashboard.  
You can record all billing steps and search or filter them easily.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune)
2. Sign up for an account or log in
3. In the dashboard, go to Settings and create a new API key
4. Copy your API key for use in your code

### PHP code examples for billing events

```php
<?php
$opsKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

$payload = [
  'name' => 'invoice paid',
  'avatar' => 'üí∞',
  'content' => 'Invoice #123 paid by John Smith for $49.99'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://events.tune/v1');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $opsKey,
    'Content-Type: application/json',
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
?>
```

This code sends an "invoice paid" event to Tune.

```php
// Tracking a failed invoice
$payload['name'] = 'invoice failed';
$payload['avatar'] = '‚ùå';
$payload['content'] = 'Invoice #124 failed for Jane Doe due to payment error';

// send as above
```

```php
// Tracking a new invoice creation
$payload['name'] = 'invoice created';
$payload['avatar'] = 'üßæ';
$payload['content'] = 'Invoice #125 created for Acme Corp for $199.00';

// send as above
```

Tune saves time by handling event storage and search for you.
