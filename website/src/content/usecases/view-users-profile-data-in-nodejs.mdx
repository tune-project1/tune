## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking service for tech products.

You can send any event data from your application to Tune.

It stores events in a central place and offers analytics over them.

## Setting up Tune

First, sign up for a free account at [app.tune](https://app.tune).

After creating an account, get your API key from the dashboard.

Use the key in your code to authenticate requests.

## Tracking profile views in Node.js

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "view profile",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "User John Smith viewed profile",
  userId: "12345",
  userName: "John Smith"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends an event to Tune each time a user views a profile page. You can later query these events for analytics.

## Conclusion

Tune helps you track user actions like profile views without building your own system.

You can save time and focus on your product.
