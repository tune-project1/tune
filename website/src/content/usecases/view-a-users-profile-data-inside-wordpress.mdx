## Why track user profile data in Wordpress

Viewing a user's profile can reveal who accessed private data and when.
This helps with security audits and compliance.
For example, you might need to know when an admin viewed a member's details.

## Using Tune for event tracking

Tune is a simple tool to record and view custom events in your app.
You can track profile views in Wordpress with minimal setup.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new project for your Wordpress site.
3. In project settings, copy your API key.
4. Add the API key to your Wordpress configuration.

## Code example in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Profile Viewed',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content' => 'Admin viewed profile of John Smith (ID: 123)'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey",
  'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
?>
```

This example sends a profile view event to Tune each time an admin opens a user's profile in Wordpress.

## Conclusion

Tune can save you time by handling event ingestion, storage, and visualization.
You do not need to build a custom logging system.
