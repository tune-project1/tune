## What this article is about

Monitoring when someone views a user profile in your Wordpress site can help you improve security and usability. For example, you can see if admin accounts are accessed unexpectedly.

## What is Tune

Tune is a lightweight event tracking service. You can send custom events from your Wordpress site to capture actions like profile views.  
It stores your events in a dashboard for real-time inspection and alerting.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.  
2. After logging in, find your API key in the settings page.  
3. Keep the key safe. You will use it in your Wordpress code.

## Code example

Here is a PHP snippet that sends an event when a user views another user's profile:

```php
<?php
// Replace with your actual API key
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';

$payload = [
    'name' => 'View Profile',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
    'content' => 'John Smith viewed Jane Doe\'s profile'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This code sends an event named "View Profile" with details about who viewed whose profile.

## Conclusion

Using Tune lets you track profile views without building your own logging system. You get a simple API and dashboard to view events in real time.
