## Understanding User Profile Viewing in WordPress

Viewing a userâ€™s profile can help admins and plugins show personalized content and track user behavior.

For example, you might want to log when a member views another memberâ€™s profile to monitor engagement or detect suspicious activity.

### What is Tune

Tune is a lightweight event tracking tool for any tech product.

You can use it to capture events when users view profiles in WordPress.

### Setting Up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.  
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.  
3. Copy the API key from the project settings.  
4. Install the Tune SDK or prepare your HTTP client.

### Tracking Profile Views with PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'view user profile',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content' => 'User John Smith viewed profile of user with ID 123'
];

$ops->events()->ingest($payload);
```

This code sends an event to Tune whenever a user views another userâ€™s profile.

### Conclusion

Tune makes it easy to track user profile views and gain insights without extra setup.
