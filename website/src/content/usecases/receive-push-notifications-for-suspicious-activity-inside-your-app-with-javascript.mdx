## What this article is about

In this article, you‚Äôll learn how to receive instant push notifications when your JavaScript app detects suspicious activity.

For example, you can catch multiple failed login attempts and alert your support team in real time.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform for any tech product.

You can send custom events for errors, security checks, or user behavior to Tune.

When a suspicious event arrives, Tune can forward it as a push notification to your team‚Äôs phones or messaging channels.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new project to get your API key.
3. Copy the API key to use in your JavaScript code.

## Code examples

### Example 1: Suspicious login attempt
```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "Suspicious login attempt",
  avatar: "üö®",
  content: "User John Smith attempted multiple failed logins"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```
This code sends a login attempt event. Tune will push an alert when it ingests this event.

### Example 2: Unusual file access
```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "Unusual file access",
  avatar: "üîí",
  content: "File "/etc/passwd" was accessed by service account 123"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```
This tracks a potentially risky file read and triggers a notification.

### Example 3: Multiple failed two-factor attempts
```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "Blocked two-factor attempts",
  avatar: "üîê",
  content: "User Alice Williams failed 2FA three times in one minute"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```
This example catches repeated two-factor failures and alerts your security team.

## Conclusion

With Tune, you can stop chasing unknown threats and get notified instantly when suspicious actions happen.
