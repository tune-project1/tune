## Why track suspicious activity in your JavaScript app?

Tracking unusual behavior in your app helps you spot potential threats before they cause damage.

For example, if a user account suddenly logs in from a new location, you can get an alert and act quickly.

## What is Tune and how it helps

Tune is an open source event tracking tool for any app.

It captures events like errors, messages, or custom alerts and sends push notifications.

You can set up rules to get notified on your device or team channels in minutes.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at https://app.tune.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK with npm install @tune/sdk.

## Code examples

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "Suspicious login attempt",
  avatar: "üö®",
  content: "Suspicious login detected for user John Doe from IP 192.168.1.10"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example sends a push notification when a suspicious login is detected.

```javascript
// Example: multiple failed login attempts
const payload2 = {
  name: "Multiple failed logins",
  avatar: "üîí",
  content: "User Jane Smith failed to log in 5 times in a row"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload2);
```

```javascript
// Example: unusual data access
const payload3 = {
  name: "Unusual data export",
  avatar: "‚ö†Ô∏è",
  content: "User Marie Curie exported a large data set unexpectedly"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload3);
```

## Conclusion

Tune can save you time and hassle by handling event tracking and push notifications for suspicious activity.
