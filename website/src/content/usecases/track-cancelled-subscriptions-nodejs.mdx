## What is cancelled subscription tracking in Node.js

Tracking when users cancel their subscriptions helps you understand churn.

In a Node.js application you can send this data to an analytics tool.

For example you might want to record who cancelled and which plan they were on.

This helps you spot trends and improve retention.

### Using Tune to track cancellations

Tune is an open source event tracking tool for any product.

You can use it to record cancellations in real time.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. In the dashboard navigate to the API keys section.
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard.
4. Install the SDK by running `npm install @tune/sdk`.

### Code example in Node.js

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "subscription cancelled",
  avatar: "❌",
  content: "Customer John Smith cancelled their subscription, id 123."
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code sends an event to Tune whenever a subscription is cancelled.

### Conclusion

Tracking cancelled subscriptions lets you find out why users leave.

Tune makes it easy by handling event ingestion and storage.
