## What is Tune

Tune is an event tracking platform.
You can send events when things happen in your app or website.
It then delivers notifications to your channels and devices.

With Tune you can alert your team about new posts fast.
You get a simple API for pushing events and notifications.

## Setting up Tune

First, sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
After logging in, go to your workspace settings to find your API key.
Copy the key and keep it safe.

You will use this key to authenticate when sending events from WordPress.

## Code example in PHP

Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` or a custom plugin.

```php
<?php
// Send a notification on new post publish
function send_tune_notification($post_id) {
  $title = get_the_title($post_id);
  $url = get_permalink($post_id);

  $payload = [
    'name' => 'New post published',
    'avatar' => '📝',
    'content' => "A new post titled \"{$title}\" was published.",
    'properties' => [
      'post_url' => $url
    ]
  ];

  $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events/ingest');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, 'YOUR_API_KEY:');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Content-Type: application/json']);
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
}

add_action('publish_post', 'send_tune_notification', 10, 1);
```

This code hooks into the post publish event in WordPress.
It sends a request to Tune with details about the new post.
Tune then delivers a push notification to your devices.
