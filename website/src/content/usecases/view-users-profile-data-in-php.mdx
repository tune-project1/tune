## What is viewing user profiles in PHP

When you build a PHP application you often need to show profile information for each user.

Tracking when a user views anotherâ€™s profile helps you understand engagement.

For example, you might log an event when John Smith sees Jane Doeâ€™s profile.

This data can help you improve user experience and tailor content.

### Introducing Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking service.

It lets you capture events from any application with minimal setup.

You can record custom events like profile views, button clicks, or page loads.

### Setup Tune

To start sending events with Tune:

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the PHP SDK or use your preferred HTTP client:
   ```bash
   composer require tune/sdk
   ```
4. Initialize the SDK in your code with your API key.

### Code example: Tracking profile view event

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name'    => 'Profile Viewed',
    'avatar'  => 'ðŸ‘¤',
    'content' => 'User John Smith viewed profile of Jane Doe'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This example sends a "Profile Viewed" event to Tune whenever someone views a user's profile. You can view it in your dashboard.

### Conclusion

Using Tune saves time by handling event capture and storage for you.

You donâ€™t need to build your own analytics backend.
