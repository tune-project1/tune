## What is signup event tracking in SaaS

Tracking when a user signs up gives you data on growth. It helps you see how marketing campaigns and onboarding work. It also shows which channels bring the most new users.

For example, if you run an email drip campaign you can measure clicks and signups to see which message resonates with users.

### Using Tune for event tracking

Tune is an open source tool for tracking events in your product. It captures events and lets you search them in real time in a dashboard. You can send data from any language or framework.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. Verify your email and log in to the dashboard.
3. Navigate to the API Keys section.
4. Click Create new key and copy your API key.

### Code example: Tracking signup events

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const eventPayload = {
  name: "user_signed_up",
  avatar: "ðŸŽ‰",
  content: "User Alicia Johnson signed up with email alicia@example.com"
};

await ops.events.ingest(eventPayload);
```

This code initializes the Tune client and sends a signup event with a user name and email.
