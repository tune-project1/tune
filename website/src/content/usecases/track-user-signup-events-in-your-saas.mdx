## Why track signup events in your SaaS

Tracking signup events helps you understand how users find and join your platform. You can measure the impact of marketing campaigns. You can see which referral sources bring the most new accounts.

For example, if a user named John Smith signs up after clicking an email link, you can capture that data. This insight helps you optimize your onboarding flow.

## Using Tune for event tracking

## Code example: Track a signup event in JavaScript

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "ðŸŽ‰",
  content: "New user signup: John Smith"
