## What is Tune

Tune is an event tracking platform that ingests custom events from any tech stack.
You can send events like profile updates and trigger push notifications to your team or users.
Tune handles storage, routing, and delivery so you focus on building features.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up for an account at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. After verifying your email, log in to find your API key in your dashboard.
3. Copy the key and keep it safeâ€”youâ€™ll use it to authenticate your requests.

## Code example in PHP

```php
<?php
// Define your API key and endpoint
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$url = 'https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest';

// Build the event payload
$payload = [
  'name'   => 'profile updated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
  'content'=> 'John Smith updated their profile picture'
];

// Initialize cURL
$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

// Send the request and capture the response
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

// Optionally handle the response
echo $response;
```

This snippet sends a "profile updated" event to Tune. Youâ€™ll then receive a push notification based on your projectâ€™s routing rules.

## Conclusion

Using Tune for push notifications saves you from building a custom event system.
It handles ingestion, storage, and delivery so you can focus on your app.
