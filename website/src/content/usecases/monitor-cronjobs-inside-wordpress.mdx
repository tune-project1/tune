## Overview

WordPress uses cron jobs to run scheduled tasks like publishing posts or cleaning up logs. If a cron job fails, it can affect site functionality and user experience.

Tracking these jobs helps you spot failures early and ensures everything runs smoothly.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool for any tech product. 

You can send custom events like cron job runs, errors, or performance metrics. 

Events appear in a dashboard where you can search, filter, and debug issues in real time.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Keep the key handy for your WordPress setup.

## Tracking cron job events in WordPress

Use PHP and cURL to send a cron job event when a scheduled task runs.

```php
<?php
// Define your API key and payload
define('OPS_API_KEY', 'YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'Cron job executed',
  'avatar' => '⏰',
  'content' => 'WordPress daily_cleanup ran successfully for user John Smith'
];

// Send event to Tune API
$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . OPS_API_KEY,
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This example sends a simple event whenever your cron job runs. Replace `daily_cleanup` and user details as needed.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to monitor WordPress cron jobs saves time and prevents unexpected failures.

You get real-time visibility into every scheduled task without building custom dashboards.
