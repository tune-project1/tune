## What is cronjob monitoring in WordPress?

WordPress uses a pseudo-cron system to schedule tasks like publishing posts, cleaning up drafts, and backup routines. If a cronjob fails, you might miss important tasks. Monitoring cronjobs helps you catch failures and ensures your site stays healthy. For example, a daily cleanup cronjob might delete old data. If it stops running, your database can fill up fast.

## Using Tune for cronjob monitoring

Tune is an open-source event tracking service. It lets you send events when a cronjob runs or fails. You can view these events in a dashboard and get alerts on issues.

By tracking cronjob success and failures, you can respond quickly and keep your site running smoothly.

## Setting up Tune

1. Visit [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.  
2. Create a new project from the dashboard.  
3. Copy the API key from project settings.  
4. Install the PHP SDK with composer:
   ```bash
   composer require @tune/sdk
   ```

## Code example for WordPress cronjob monitoring

These examples show how to report cronjob success and failure events in PHP.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name'   => 'cronjob success',
  'avatar' => '🕒',
  'content'=> 'Cleanup cronjob completed for June 14',
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name'   => 'cronjob failed',
  'avatar' => '❌',
  'content'=> 'Backup cronjob did not run on June 14',
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
