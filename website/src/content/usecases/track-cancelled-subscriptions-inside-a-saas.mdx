## What is subscription cancellation tracking in SaaS

Subscription cancellation tracking helps you understand churn in your product. When a user cancels a plan, you capture data like user ID, plan name, and reason. For example, if John Smith ends a Pro Plan subscription, tracking helps you spot trends and improve retention.

## Using Tune for tracking cancellations

Tune captures events from any tech product in real time. You can send cancellation events and view them on a unified dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Navigate to Settings to find your API key.
4. Install the SDK in your codebase.

## Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "subscription cancelled",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "User John Smith cancelled subscription, plan: Pro Plan",
  properties: {
    userId: 1234,
    plan: "Pro Plan",
    reason: "No longer needed"
  }
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends a cancellation event with details about the user, plan, and reason.

## Conclusion

Tracking cancellations helps reduce churn and improve your product.

Tune saves you time by handling event collection and visualization.
