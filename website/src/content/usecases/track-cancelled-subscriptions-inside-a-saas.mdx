## What this article covers

Tracking when users cancel their subscriptions is key to understanding churn in your SaaS app. By logging cancellation events you can spot patterns and take action to improve retention.

Imagine you run a video streaming service. When a user like John Smith cancels his monthly plan, you want to capture that event immediately to follow up or analyze trends.

## What is Tune

Tune is a simple event tracking SDK that sends user actions from your app to a central dashboard. You can use it to record cancellations, sign-ups, errors, and more in real time.

It stores each event with metadata so you can filter, search, and build reports on why users leave your service.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and create an account.
2. In the dashboard, generate a new API key for your project.
3. Copy the key and keep it safe.
4. Install the SDK in your app using npm or yarn.

Once you have your key, you can start sending events right away.

## Code example: Track cancelled subscriptions

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "subscription cancelled",
  avatar: "❌",
  content: "User John Smith cancelled subscription 123"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This snippet sends a `subscription cancelled` event to Tune with the user's name and subscription ID.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to track cancellations saves you time on building a custom logging system. You get instant insight into churn and can act on trends faster.
