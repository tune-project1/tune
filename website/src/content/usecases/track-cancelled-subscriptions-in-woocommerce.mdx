## What is subscription cancellation tracking in WooCommerce

Tracking when customers cancel their subscriptions helps you understand churn and improve your offerings.

For example, if a user with a monthly plan ends their subscription, you can log this event and follow up with a retention campaign.

### Why use Tune for tracking cancellations

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool that makes logging events easy.

It offers a simple SDK to send events and a dashboard to view them.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new project for your WooCommerce store.
3. Copy the API key from the project settings.
4. Install the Tune PHP SDK via Composer.

### Code example

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Sdk;

$ops = new Sdk("API_KEY");

$payload = [
  "name" => "subscription cancelled",
  "avatar" => "❌",
  "content" => "Subscription ID 123 for John Smith has been cancelled"
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This snippet sends an event when a customer cancels a subscription. It uses the Tune PHP SDK, sets the event name, avatar, and content with cancellation details.

### Conclusion

Tracking cancellations in WooCommerce with Tune can save you time and provide clear insights on churn.

You can see all events in the dashboard and react quickly.
