## What is Tune

Tune is a service that tracks events from any app or site.
You can use it to log actions and get real-time alerts.
It gives you an API and a dashboard to see all your events in one place.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up or log in.
2. In the dashboard, copy your API key from the settings.
3. Keep the key safe. Youâ€™ll need it in your code to send events.

## Code example in PHP

Below is a PHP snippet that hooks into the WooCommerce profile update event and sends a notification to Tune.

```php
add_action('profile_update', 'send_profile_update_event', 10, 2);

function send_profile_update_event($user_id, $old_user_data) {
    $user_info = get_userdata($user_id);
    $api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

    $payload = [
        'name'   => 'Profile updated',
        'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
        'content'=> $user_info->display_name . ' updated their email to ' . $user_info->user_email
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        'Authorization: Bearer ' . $api_key,
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
}
```

This code listens for any profile update in WooCommerce and sends an event with the userâ€™s new email.

## Conclusion

Tune makes it easy to track user profile updates in WooCommerce and get instant alerts.
It saves you from writing complex logging logic and lets you focus on your store.
