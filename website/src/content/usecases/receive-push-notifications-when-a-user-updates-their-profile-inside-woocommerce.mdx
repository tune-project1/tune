## Why track WooCommerce profile updates?

When a customer updates their profile on your WooCommerce store, you might want to know right away.

Real-time alerts help you monitor user activity and improve support.

### Tracking events with Tune

### Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project for your WooCommerce store.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep your API key handy for your PHP code.

### Code example: Sending profile update events in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

$payload = [
  'name' => 'User profile updated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
  'content' => 'Customer Jane Doe updated her address',
  'properties' => [
    'user_id' => 456,
    'email' => 'jane.doe@example.com'
  ]
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo $response;
```

This PHP snippet sends a profile update event to Tune with user details.
