## What is Tune?

Tune is an open-source tool for capturing and visualizing events from your application. It makes it easy to send events like signups, errors, or purchases. You can view them in real time, filter by properties, and integrate with other tools.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project to get your API key.
3. Copy the API key and save it in your PHP project, for example in an environment variable.

## Code example

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

// Initialize the SDK with your API key
$ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  "name" => "user signup",
  "avatar" => "ðŸŽ‰",
  "content" => "New user Jane Doe signed up with email jane@example.com"
];

// Send the signup event to Tune
$ops->events->ingest($payload);
?>
```

The snippet above sets up the Tune client and sends a signup event with the new user's name and email.

## Conclusion

Tracking signup events helps you understand user behavior and improve growth strategies. Tune simplifies event capture and analysis. Learn more at https://tune and try the [playground](https://tune/playground) to test snippets.
