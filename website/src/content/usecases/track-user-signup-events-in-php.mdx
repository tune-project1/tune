## What is user signup tracking in PHP

Tracking user signup events helps you know who is joining your app.

In an ecommerce site, you can see when a new account is created.

You can use this data to measure marketing, track conversions and spot issues quickly.

### Introducing Tune for event tracking

Tune is an open source tool to collect events from any tech product.

It lets you send custom events and view them in a simple dashboard.

You can use it to track signups in your PHP application.

### Setting up Tune

2. Create a new project and copy the API key.
3. In your PHP project run:

   ```bash
   composer require tune/sdk-php
   ```

4. Use your API key in code to send events.

### Tracking signup events in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'user signup',
  'avatar' => 'üÜï',
  'content' => 'New user John Smith signed up with email john@example.com'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
