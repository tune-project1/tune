## What this article covers

Tracking user signup events in your Node.js application helps you see growth and improve onboarding.

For example, an e-commerce site can monitor daily signups and tailor promotions to new users.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform. It captures events like signups, purchases, and errors from any app.

You can view and filter events in the dashboard or forward them to other tools for deeper analysis.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. Set up a new project and copy the API key from project settings.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```

## Code snippet

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "ðŸŽ‰",
  content: "New user signup: John Smith (ID 123)"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code initializes the SDK and sends a signup event with user details to Tune.

## Conclusion

Tune makes it quick to track events without building a custom backend.
