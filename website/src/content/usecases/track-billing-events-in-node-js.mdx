## What is billing event tracking in Node.js

Tracking billing events helps you monitor when your users make payments or subscribe to plans.

For example, you can capture when a customer purchases a subscription to your Pro plan.

## Using Tune to track billing events

Tune is an open source platform for capturing and managing events from your applications.

You can send billing events from your code and view them in a unified dashboard.
