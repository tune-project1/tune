## What are push notifications for profile updates

When your app lets users change their profile you may want to notify other parts of your system or your team. For example, you can alert support if a user changes their email or picture. Push notifications help you stay informed when users update profile details.

## Track profile updates with Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. You can use it to send profile update events and trigger notifications. The dashboard shows events and payload details.

## Setting up Tune

1. Visit https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js project.
4. Add your API key to your code as shown below.

## Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

// Call this after a user updates their profile
async function notifyProfileUpdate(userId, name) {
  const payload = {
    name: "user profile updated",
    avatar: "ðŸ””",
    content: `${name} updated their profile`
  }

  await ops.events.ingest(payload)
}

notifyProfileUpdate(123, "John Smith")
```

This example sends a profile update event when a user changes their profile. You can see it in your Tune dashboard.

## Conclusion

Tune saves time and reduces manual work when you track events and send notifications.
