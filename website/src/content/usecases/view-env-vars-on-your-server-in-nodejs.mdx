## What are environment variables in Node.js servers?

Environment variables store configuration outside your code. They let you change settings without editing files.

For example, you might set PORT to tell your app which port to listen on. You can also store API keys or mode settings.

Viewing these values at runtime helps you debug issues quickly and ensure your server runs with the right configuration.

## Using Tune to track variable access

Tune is an open source tool for tracking events in your applications.

You can log when and how you read environment variables. This helps you audit configuration loads across environments.

## Setting up Tune

First, create a free account and get your API key:

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Verify your email and log in to the dashboard.
3. Copy your project API key from the settings page.
4. Install the SDK in your project with `npm install @tune/sdk`.

## Code example: Logging environment variables

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const port = process.env.PORT || "3000"
const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development"

const payload = {
  name: "view environment variables",
  avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
  content: `Loaded PORT=${port} and NODE_ENV=${mode}`
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This example shows how to read `PORT` and `NODE_ENV` in Node.js and send an event to Tune with those values.

## Conclusion

Viewing environment variables helps you debug and manage your server config.

Tune makes logging these events easy and consistent.
