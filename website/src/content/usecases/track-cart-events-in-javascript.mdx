## What is cart event tracking in JavaScript?

Tracking cart events helps you understand user actions in your online store.
When someone adds or removes a product from the cart
or starts the checkout process
you can capture these events to improve sales and user experience.
For example
you can track how many users add a specific product
and optimize your inventory.

### Using Tune for event tracking

Tune lets you send and view events in real time.
You can see cart actions as they happen.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard.
3. In your project folder run:
   ```
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. In your code import and initialize the SDK with your API key.

### Code examples

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune('API_KEY')

// Example 1: add to cart
const payloadAdd = {
  name: 'add to cart',
  avatar: 'ðŸ›’',
  content: 'User John Smith added product ID 123 to cart'
}
await ops.events.ingest(payloadAdd)

// Example 2: remove from cart
const payloadRemove = {
  name: 'remove from cart',
  avatar: 'ðŸ›’',
  content: 'User John Smith removed product ID 123 from cart'
}
await ops.events.ingest(payloadRemove)

// Example 3: checkout initiated
const payloadCheckout = {
  name: 'checkout initiated',
  avatar: 'ðŸ’³',
  content: 'User John Smith started checkout for order 456'
}
await ops.events.ingest(payloadCheckout)

// Example 4: purchase completed
const payloadPurchase = {
  name: 'purchase completed',
