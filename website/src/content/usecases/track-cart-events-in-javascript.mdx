This article explains how to track shopping cart interactions in JavaScript using Tune. Tracking cart events helps you understand user behavior.

For example, you can log when a user adds items to see which products are most popular.

## 2. What is Tune

Tune is an open source tool for logging events from your app. Use it to record user actions, errors, and business metrics.

You send events with a name, avatar, and content. Tune stores and displays them in real time.

## 3. Setup Tune

First, sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) to get your free account.

After signing up, go to your dashboard and copy your API key.

Keep this key handy. You will use it in your code to send events.

## 4. Code examples

Import the SDK and create a client with your API key.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Add item to cart
const addPayload = {
  name: "Added item to cart",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "User John Smith added product ID 123 to the cart"
};
await ops.events.ingest(addPayload);

// Remove item from cart
const removePayload = {
  name: "Removed item from cart",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "User John Smith removed product ID 123 from the cart"
};
await ops.events.ingest(removePayload);

// Start checkout
const checkoutPayload = {
  name: "Checkout started",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "User John Smith started checkout for order ID 456"
};
await ops.events.ingest(checkoutPayload);
```

These examples show how to log cart add, remove, and checkout events.
