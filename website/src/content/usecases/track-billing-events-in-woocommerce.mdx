## Why track billing events in WooCommerce

Tracking billing events in your WooCommerce store helps you keep an eye on sales, payments and refunds.
For example, you can monitor when a customer completes an order or requests a refund.
This data can improve customer service and spot issues quickly.

## Using Tune for billing event tracking

Tune is an event tracking platform for any tech product.
You can send billing events from WooCommerce to Tune and view them in real time.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Log in and open the API Keys page.
3. Click Create new key and give it a name.
4. Copy the API key to use in your code.

## Code examples

```php
<?php
$apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
$url = "https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest";

$payload = [
  "name" => "New order completed",
  "avatar" => "🛒",
  "content" => "Order #1234 for John Smith was paid",
  "metadata" => [
    "order_id" => 1234,
    "amount" => 59.99,
    "currency" => "USD"
  ]
];

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  "Content-Type: application/json",
  "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This code sends a "New order completed" event to Tune with order details.

```php
<?php
// Track payment failure
$payload = [
  "name" => "Payment failed",
  "avatar" => "❌",
  "content" => "Order #1245 for Alice Johnson failed to process",
  "metadata" => [
    "order_id" => 1245,
    "reason" => "card_declined"
  ]
];

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_exec($ch);
```

```php
<?php
// Track refund
$payload = [
  "name" => "Order refunded",
  "avatar" => "💰",
  "content" => "Order #1234 for John Smith was refunded",
  "metadata" => [
    "order_id" => 1234,
    "refund_amount" => 59.99
  ]
];

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_exec($ch);
```
