## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool. It lets you collect structured events from any tech product.

You can send purchase, refund, or subscription events and view them in one dashboard. This helps you keep an eye on key billing activities.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard.

Youâ€™ll use this key to send events from your WooCommerce store to Tune.

## Tracking billing events in WooCommerce

Below are code examples in PHP that show how to send different billing events. Each snippet uses curl to post an event.

### 1. Order placed
```php
<?php
$apiKey = "API_KEY";
$payload = [
  "name" => "Order placed",
  "avatar" => "ðŸ’³",
  "content" => "Order #12345 by John Doe for $49.99 completed"
];

$ch = curl_init("https://api.tune/v1/events");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    "Content-Type: application/json",
    "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo $response;
?>
```
This sends an event when a new order is placed.

### 2. Refund processed
```php
<?php
$apiKey = "API_KEY";
$payload = [
  "name" => "Refund processed",
  "avatar" => "ðŸ’¸",
  "content" => "Refund of $15.00 for Order #12345 issued to Jane Smith"
];
// same curl setup as above
```
This logs when a refund is issued.

### 3. Subscription renewed
```php
<?php
$apiKey = "API_KEY";
$payload = [
  "name" => "Subscription renewed",
  "avatar" => "ðŸ”„",
  "content" => "Monthly plan renewed for User ID 67890"
];
// same curl setup as above
```
This records each subscription renewal.
