## Why track user signups in WooCommerce

Tracking user signups helps you understand how customers register on your store.

For example, you might want to know how many users sign up each day to monitor growth.

## Using Tune to track signups

Tune provides a simple way to send and view events from your application.

You can stream signup events directly to your Tune dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a project for your WooCommerce store.
3. Navigate to API Keys and copy your write key.
4. Store the API key securely in your application environment.

## Example PHP code to track signup events

```php
<?php
$apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
$payload = [
  "name" => "User Signup",
  "avatar" => "üë§",
  "content" => "New user Alice Johnson signed up"
];

$ch = curl_init("https://api.tune/events");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  "Content-Type: application/json",
  "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
echo $response;
```

This code sends a signup event to Tune with the user's name and avatar.

## Conclusion

Tune lets you track WooCommerce user signups without building custom logging systems.
