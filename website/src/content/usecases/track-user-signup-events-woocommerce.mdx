# Track user signup events in WooCommerce

## What this article is about

In this article, weâ€™ll look at why tracking user signup events in WooCommerce helps you understand customer growth.

When someone registers on your store, you capture their details and send an event to Tune. That way you can monitor signup trends and act on them.

## What is Tune and why use it

Tune is an event tracking tool designed to simplify how you collect and view product events.

You can log any event from your WooCommerce store and see it in a live feed. This gives you real-time insight into user activity.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and create an account.
2. In your dashboard, find your API key under Settings.
3. Store your API key in a safe place. Youâ€™ll need it in your WooCommerce code.

## Code example for tracking user signup in PHP

```php
// Include this in your themeâ€™s functions.php or a custom plugin
add_action('user_register', 'send_signup_event_to_tune', 10, 1);

function send_signup_event_to_tune($user_id) {
    $user = get_userdata($user_id);
    $apiKey = 'API_KEY';
    $payload = [
        'name'    => 'user signup',
        'avatar'  => 'ðŸŽ‰',
        'content' => 'New user signup: ' . $user->display_name . ' (ID: ' . $user_id . ')'
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey,
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
}
```
