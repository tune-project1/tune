## What is user signup tracking in JavaScript

Tracking user signup events helps you understand new user growth. It shows when and how users join your service. By capturing signup data, you can measure marketing success and improve onboarding flow. For example, you can see which sources drive the most registrations.

### Using Tune for event tracking

Tune lets you capture and view signup events in real time. You can send events from your JavaScript code and see them on the dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK with npm:
   ```bash
   npm install @tuneco/sdk
   ```

### Tracking signup events in JavaScript

```javascript
import Tune from "@tuneco/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "ðŸ†•",
  content: "User Jane Doe signed up"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code initializes the Tune client, creates a payload for a signup event, and sends it to your project. You can see the event in your Tune dashboard.

### Conclusion

With Tune, you can save time by quickly tracking signup events without building your own system. It gives you real-time insights into user onboarding.
