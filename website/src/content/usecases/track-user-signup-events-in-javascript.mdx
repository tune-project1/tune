## What is user signup event tracking in JavaScript?

Tracking a user signup event means recording when a person creates an account on your site or app. This data helps you see how many new users join over time.

For example, an online store can track the number of signups launched by different marketing campaigns. That insight helps you invest in the most effective channels.

## What is Tune?

Tune is an open-source service for collecting and storing events from your app. You can send events from your front end or back end and view them in a dashboard.

You define event names and attach details like user id or email. Tune keeps these events so you can search, filter, and analyze them later.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. In the dashboard, copy your API key from the project settings.
3. Install the SDK in your JavaScript project:  
   ```
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Add your API key to your code so you can send events.

## Tracking signup events in JavaScript

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY')

const payload = {
  name: 'user signup',
  avatar: 'ðŸŽ‰',
  content: 'New user Jane Doe registered.',
  email: 'jane.doe@example.com'
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code sends a "user signup" event with details about the new user to Tune.

## Conclusion

Recording signup events helps you monitor growth and improve onboarding.

Tune saves you time by handling event storage and retrieval. You can build queries in the dashboard or use the [playground](https://tune/playground) to try code snippets.
