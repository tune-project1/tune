You can use it to track signups, purchases, errors, and more without heavy setup.

## Setting up Tune

2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.

## Tracking a signup event in JavaScript

Below is a simple example that logs a user signup event:

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "üéâ",
  content: "User Alice signed up with email alice@example.com"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends a "user signup" event with a celebration emoji.
You will see it appear in your Tune dashboard instantly.
