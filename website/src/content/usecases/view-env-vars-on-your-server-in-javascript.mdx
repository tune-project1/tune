# Why view environment variables on your server in JavaScript

Viewing environment variables on your server helps you debug configuration issues.

For example, you might need to confirm that NODE_ENV is set to production before starting your server.

# What is Tune and how to use it

Tune is a simple event tracking service for any tech product.

You can send events when you view or update env vars. This helps audit access and debugging.

# Setting up Tune

1. Visit [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project and locate your API key in the project settings.
3. Install the SDK in your project with `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Save the API key in a secure env var on your server, for example `OP_API_KEY`.

# Code examples

Below is a Node.js example showing how to read server env vars and send them as an event to Tune.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune(process.env.OP_API_KEY);

const envVars = {
  PATH: process.env.PATH,
  NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  PORT: process.env.PORT
};

const payload = {
  name: "server environment variables viewed",
  avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
  content: `Env vars: PATH=${envVars.PATH}, NODE_ENV=${envVars.NODE_ENV}, PORT=${envVars.PORT}`
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code reads key environment variables and sends them to Tune as an event.

# Conclusion

Using Tune to log env var access can save you time and hassle when debugging.
