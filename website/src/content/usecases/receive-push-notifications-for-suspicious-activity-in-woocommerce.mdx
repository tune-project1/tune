## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform. It captures events from your app or website and shows them in real time.
You can define custom events, like suspicious activity, and get instant notifications on your phone or desktop.

Use Tune to get better visibility into your WooCommerce store. Track security events, order anomalies, and more without writing complex integrations.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and log in.
2. Go to your project and copy the API key from the settings page.
3. Install the PHP cURL extension if you don’t have it.
4. Keep your API key handy. You’ll use it in the code snippets below.

## Code examples

Below are three examples showing how to send push notifications for different suspicious activities in WooCommerce. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you got from the dashboard.

### Example 1: Suspicious login attempts

This code sends an alert when a user fails to log in.

```php
<?php
function notify_suspicious_login() {
  $payload = [
    'name' => 'Suspicious Login Attempt',
    'avatar' => '🚨',
    'content' => 'Multiple failed login attempts for user john@example.com'
  ];

  $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/ingest');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
  ]);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
}

add_action('wp_login_failed', 'notify_suspicious_login');
```

### Example 2: High-value order detection

This code alerts you when an order over $500 is placed.

```php
<?php
function notify_high_value_order($order_id) {
  $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
  if ($order->get_total() > 500) {
    $payload = [
      'name' => 'High-Value Order Detected',
      'avatar' => '💰',
      'content' => 'Order #1024 for $750 placed by john@example.com'
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
      'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type: application/json'
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
  }
}

add_action('woocommerce_thankyou', 'notify_high_value_order', 10, 1);
```

### Example 3: Multiple payment failures

This code sends a notification when a customer’s payment fails three times.

```php
<?php
function track_failed_payments($order_id) {
  $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
  $failures = get_user_meta($order->get_user_id(), 'payment_failures', true) + 1;
  update_user_meta($order->get_user_id(), 'payment_failures', $failures);

  if ($failures >= 3) {
    $payload = [
      'name' => 'Payment Failures Alert',
      'avatar' => '⚠️',
      'content' => 'User john@example.com had 3 payment failures'
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
      'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type: application/json'
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
  }
}

add_action('woocommerce_order_status_failed', 'track_failed_payments', 10, 1);
```
