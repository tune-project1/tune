## Why get push alerts for suspicious activity in WooCommerce

Suspicious actions in your store can lead to chargebacks or fraud.

Getting real-time notifications helps you react quickly.

For example, if someone tries multiple failed logins or places a high-value order from a new location, you want to know right away.

Push alerts bring those events to your phone or Slack so you can investigate immediately.

## What is Tune and how it works

Tune is a lightweight event tracking tool.

It lets you send custom events when something important happens in your app.

You can set up push notifications for any event, including suspicious orders or login attempts.

It works with a simple HTTP API or SDK.

You can view events in the dashboard or forward them to Slack, email, or webhooks.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new workspace for your WooCommerce store.
3. In the dashboard, copy your API key from Settings > API Keys.
4. Install the PHP SDK or ensure cURL is available on your server.
5. Add your API key to your WooCommerce plugin or theme code.

## Tracking suspicious activity in PHP

```php
<?php
// Include dependencies or ensure cURL is enabled

$apiKey = 'API_KEY';

// Example payload for a suspicious login attempt
data:
$payload = [
    'name' => 'Suspicious login attempt',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸš¨',
    'content' => 'User John Smith from IP 192.168.0.1 had 5 failed login attempts'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This code sends a custom event to Tune whenever a login attempt fails multiple times. You can adapt it to track orders, cart changes, and more.

## Conclusion

With Tune, you get instant alerts for any suspicious activity in WooCommerce.

That saves time and helps you stop fraud before it happens.
