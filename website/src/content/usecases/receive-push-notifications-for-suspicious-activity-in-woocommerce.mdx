## Monitor suspicious activity in WooCommerce

Your WooCommerce store can face login attacks, fake orders, or bot traffic. When you see many failed login attempts or strange order patterns, you need to know immediately. Getting push notifications helps you act fast and protect your store.

### What is Tune?

4. Store the API key securely for your WooCommerce site.

### PHP code example for sending notifications

The following snippet shows how to send a push notification when you detect multiple failed login attempts in WooCommerce. It posts an event with a name, avatar, and content to Tune.

```php
<?php
// Replace with your API key
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Prepare event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'Suspicious activity detected',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸš¨',
  'content' => 'Multiple failed login attempts detected for user john.doe@example.com'
];

// Send event to Tune
$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events.ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'POST');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey,
]);
curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
?>
```

This code sends an event to Tune whenever you detect suspicious login attempts. It helps you get instant push notifications.
