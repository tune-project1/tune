## What is cronjob monitoring in PHP?

If you're using a 3rd party API for cronjobs, or using Cronmon or something similar, monitoring cronjobs in PHP helps you ensure scheduled tasks run as expected.

For example, you might have a nightly backup or report generation.

Tracking their success and failures lets you respond quickly to issues.

### Track cronjobs with Tune

Tune is an open-source platform for tracking events in your applications.

You can use it to log cronjob runs, failures, and performance metrics.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project for your PHP application.
3. Navigate to the project settings to find your API key.
4. Copy the API key and store it in a safe place or environment variable.

### Code examples

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'cronjob_success',
  'avatar' => '‚úÖ',
  'content' => 'Daily report cronjob finished successfully in 85 seconds'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey,
  'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo $result;
?>
```

This example logs a successful cronjob run.

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'cronjob_failure',
  'avatar' => 'üö®',
  'content' => 'Backup cronjob failed with exit code 1'
];

// ... send HTTP request as above ...
?>
```

This example reports a cronjob failure.

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'cronjob_skipped',
  'avatar' => '‚è≠Ô∏è',
  'content' => 'Cleanup cronjob skipped due to active lock file'
];

// ... send HTTP request as above ...
?>
```

This example tracks a skipped cronjob due to a lock.

### Conclusion

Using Tune to monitor your PHP cronjobs can save you time and reduce headaches.

You get real-time visibility into job status, run times, and errors.
