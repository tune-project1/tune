## Why view environment variables on your server

Environment variables store sensitive info like API keys, database URLs, and secrets. Viewing them helps debug configuration issues. For example, if your app can‚Äôt connect to a database, checking the DB_URL value can reveal typos or missing credentials.

## Tracking environment access with Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform. It logs actions in your system and sends them to a central dashboard. You can use it to track when and how often you view env vars on a server.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new workspace or select an existing one.
3. In workspace settings, find and copy your API key.
4. Keep your API key safe. You‚Äôll need it for cURL requests.

## Tracking env var views with cURL

Use the following command to send an event to Tune each time you fetch environment variables:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tune/events?api_key=API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "view environment variables",
    "avatar": "üîç",
    "content": "Fetched environment variables on server using cURL"
  }'
```

This command posts a JSON payload to Tune. It records the event name, avatar, and a brief description.

## Conclusion

Tracking environment variable access helps with auditing and debugging. Tune makes it easy to log these actions automatically. Visit https://tune to learn more. Try the [playground](https://tune/playground) for quick snippets and demos.
