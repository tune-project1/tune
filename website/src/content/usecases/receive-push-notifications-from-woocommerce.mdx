## What are push notifications in WooCommerce

Push notifications let you send real-time alerts to your app or dashboard when certain events happen in WooCommerce. For example, you can get a notification for every new order.

These alerts help you stay on top of orders without checking your store continuously.

## Track WooCommerce notifications with Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. You can use it to capture and visualize events like new orders.

2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the Tune PHP SDK or use the API.
4. Keep your API key handy for the code snippet.

## Code example: Sending push notifications from WooCommerce

The example below hooks into the WooCommerce order event and sends a push notification to Tune.

```php
<?php
// Add this to your theme's functions.php or a custom plugin

add_action('woocommerce_thankyou', 'send_push_notification');

function send_push_notification($order_id) {
    $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
    $name = 'New WooCommerce Order';
    $avatar = 'ðŸ›’';
    $content = "Order #{$order_id} from {$order->get_billing_first_name()} {$order->get_billing_last_name()}";

    $body = json_encode([
        'name' => $name,
        'avatar' => $avatar,
        'content' => $content
    ]);

    wp_remote_post('https://api.tune/v1/events', [
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
        ],
        'body' => $body
    ]);
}
```

This code listens for new orders and sends the order info to Tune.
