## What are WooCommerce push notifications

Push notifications let you get real-time alerts when certain events happen in your WooCommerce store. For example, you can receive a notification when a new order is placed.

Tracking these events helps you stay on top of your store activity and respond faster.

### Tracking notifications with Tune

Tune is an event tracking service that captures and displays events from any application. You can send WooCommerce notifications to Tune and view them in a dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new API key from your workspace settings.
3. Copy the API key for your integration.
4. Keep the key handy for your code.

### Example code

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'New WooCommerce Order',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ“¦',
  'content' => 'Order #12345 placed by John Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This example shows how to ingest a new order event into Tune when WooCommerce sends a push notification.

### Conclusion

Tune saves time and reduces the effort of building your own notification system. You can monitor events in one place and act on them quickly.
