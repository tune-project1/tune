## Why track suspicious activity in Node.js

Keeping your Node.js application secure means spotting unusual behavior fast. One example is repeated failed login attempts from the same IP. If you miss these, they can lead to brute force attacks or account takeovers.

By receiving push notifications, you can act on suspicious events right away. This helps you protect user data and maintain trust.

## Using Tune for suspicious activity alerts

Tune is an open source event tracking tool for any tech product. You can use it to send alerts when your app detects suspicious behavior.

With Tune, you send events via a simple SDK and get instant notifications. It integrates with your workflow and saves you time on building custom alert systems.

## Setup Tune in Node.js

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project to get your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your app folder:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```

4. Copy your API key and note it for your code.

## Code example: Sending push notifications

The following code listens for suspicious events and sends a push notification using Tune.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Example when you detect a suspicious event
async function alertSuspiciousActivity(ip) {
  const payload = {
    name: "Suspicious Activity Detected",
    avatar: "ðŸš¨",
    content: `Multiple failed login attempts from IP ${ip}`
  }

  await ops.events.ingest(payload)
}

// Trigger the alert
alertSuspiciousActivity("192.168.1.100")
```

This code sets up the Tune client, creates a payload with details of the suspicious activity, and sends it. You will receive a push notification as soon as the event is ingested.

## Conclusion

Using Tune lets you skip building custom alert systems. You get instant push notifications for suspicious activity and can respond faster.
