## What is Tune

Tune is an event tracking platform. It lets you record and monitor important events in your application.

You can use it to capture security-related events and trigger alerts in real time.

## Setting up Tune

Sign up for a free account at [app.tune](https://app.tune).

Once logged in, create a new project and copy your API key.

You'll use this key to authenticate your events with Tune.

## Tracking suspicious activity in Node.js

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function notifySuspiciousActivity(userId) {
  const payload = {
    name: "Suspicious activity detected",
    avatar: "ðŸš¨",
    content: "Multiple failed login attempts for user ID " + userId
  };

  await ops.events.ingest(payload);
}

notifySuspiciousActivity(123);
```

This code snippet sends a push notification to Tune when multiple failed login attempts are detected for a user.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to track suspicious activity in Node.js saves time and reduces manual monitoring.
