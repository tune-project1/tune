## Why track profile updates in PHP

Knowing when a user changes their profile helps keep your system in sync. You might need to update a CRM or alert admins when contact details change.

For example, if a user updates their email address, you want other services to know immediately.

## Using Tune for notifications

Tune is a simple event tracking service. You can send structured events and trigger notifications or workflows.

With one API call, you send any event and let Tune handle delivery and routing.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Keep the key safe; you'll use it in your code.

## Send profile update event with PHP

The code below shows how to post a profile update event to Tune. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from your dashboard.

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$data = [
    'name' => 'user profile updated',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
    'content' => 'John Smith updated their profile email to john@example.com'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey,
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
?>
```

This snippet sends a push notification event when a user updates their profile.

## Conclusion

Tune saves time by handling your event delivery and notifications. You donâ€™t need to build your own infrastructure.
