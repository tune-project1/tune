## What is billing event tracking in WordPress

Tracking billing events in your WordPress site helps you monitor purchases, subscriptions, and revenue.

For example, you can log when a customer completes a purchase or renews a subscription.

This data helps you analyze sales trends and improve your checkout flow.

### Tracking billing events with Tune

Tune is an open-source event-tracking tool that lets you capture events from any tech product.

You can use Tune to send billing events from your WordPress site.

This lets you view events in real time and build dashboards or alerts.

### Setting up Tune

1. Sign up or log in at https://app.tune  
2. Create a new project and copy your API key  
3. Install the PHP SDK by running  
   composer require tune-co/sdk  
4. Keep your API key secure for use in your application

### Code example: Tracking billing events in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\SDK;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name'    => 'billing_success',
  'avatar'  => 'ðŸ’³',
  'content' => 'Order #1234 was successfully billed for John Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code initializes the Tune client and sends a billing_success event with order details.

### Conclusion

Tune makes it easy to track billing events in WordPress without building your own analytics.

You save time and get real-time insights with minimal code.
