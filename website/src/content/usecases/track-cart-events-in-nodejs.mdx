## What is cart event tracking in Node.js

Tracking cart events in your Node.js application helps you understand user behavior and optimize your sales funnel. For example, you can see when a user adds or removes items from their cart. This insight lets you spot drop-offs and improve your checkout flow.

## Using Tune for cart event tracking

Tune is an open source analytics tool that captures events from any product. You can send cart events to Tune and view them in real time.

## Code example

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "cart_item_added",
