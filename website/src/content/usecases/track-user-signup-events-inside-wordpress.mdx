## Why track user signup events in WordPress

Tracking user signups helps you understand where new users come from and how they join your site. You can use this data to improve your marketing and onboarding process.

For example, you can see if social media campaigns drive more signups than email referrals.

## Using Tune to track WordPress signups

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. It lets you collect and analyze events from any tech product.

You can use it to send signup events from WordPress to a central dashboard.

  'content' => 'John Doe just signed up',
  'tags' => ['wordpress', 'signup'],
  'environment' => 'production'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://events.tune/v1/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
