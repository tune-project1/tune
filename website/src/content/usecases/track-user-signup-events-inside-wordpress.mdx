## What this article is about

Tracking when users sign up on your WordPress site helps you understand growth and spot signup issues. You can log each new registration, tie it to campaigns, or trigger welcome flows.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking service. You can send any structured event data from your app to Tune.

It stores your events and offers a dashboard for searching, filtering, and visualizing them.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. After verifying your email, create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings page. Youâ€™ll need it in your code.

## Code example: Tracking a signup in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

// Initialize SDK with your API key
$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Prepare signup event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Signed Up',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¥',
  'content' => 'New user Jane Doe signed up with email jane@example.com'
];

// Send event to Tune
$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This snippet initializes Tune with your API key and sends a signup event whenever a new user registers.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to track signup events in WordPress saves time on building logging systems. You get instant visibility into user growth and can troubleshoot registration issues quickly.
