## What is profile view tracking in Node.js

Tracking when a user views their profile is important. It helps you understand user behavior.

For example, you can see which users check their profile the most. This data can guide product decisions.

### What is Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. You can send events from any tech stack.

It shows your data in real time in a simple dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy the API key from the project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your Node.js app.

### Tracking profile view event with code

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "view_profile",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "User John Smith viewed their profile"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends a "view_profile" event to Tune. You can see it in your dashboard.

### Conclusion

Tune saves time by giving you a quick way to track events. You don't need to build your own tracking system.
