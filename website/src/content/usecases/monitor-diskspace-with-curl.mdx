## What this article covers

Monitoring disk space on servers helps prevent outages and performance issues.

Imagine a web server where logs and application data fill up quickly. Without alerts, you might run out of storage and crash.

## What is Tune?

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool for tech products.
It lets you send structured events like disk space warnings directly from scripts or applications.
You can view, search, and alert on these events in a central dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

First, sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.

Next, navigate to Settings and copy your API key.
You'll use this key to authenticate cURL requests.

## Sending disk space events with cURL

Use the following command to report disk space usage:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.tune/v1/events/structured \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "Disk space low",
    "avatar": "ðŸ’½",
    "content": "Server alpha has only 10% disk space left."
}'
```

This command sends a Disk space low event to Tune.

## Conclusion

Tune saves time by centralizing disk space alerts and other events in one place.
You can track and search events easily without building your own system.
