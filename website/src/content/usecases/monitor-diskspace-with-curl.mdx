## What is disk space monitoring with cURL

Monitoring disk space helps ensure your servers do not run out of storage and keep applications running smoothly.

Using cURL to send alerts lets you automate notifications when space is low.

### How Tune helps with disk space monitoring

Tune provides a simple API to ingest events from any tool or script.
You can send disk space alerts directly to your tune dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. In your project settings, find your API key.
4. Copy the API key for use in your scripts.

### Example: Sending disk space alerts with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://events.tune/v1/ingest -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{
  "name": "Low disk space",
  "avatar": "ðŸ’½",
  "content": "Disk space is below threshold on server1: only 5% remaining"
}'
```

This command sends a low disk space alert to Tune when storage runs low.

If you prefer an entire bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set your API key here
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

# Path to check
CHECK_PATH="/var/www"

# Threshold percentage
THRESHOLD=10

# Get available disk space as a percentage (removes the % sign)
USAGE=$(df -h "$CHECK_PATH" | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

# If usage is 90% or more, disk space is less than 10%
if [ "$USAGE" -ge $((100 - THRESHOLD)) ]; then
  curl -X POST https://events.tune/v1/ingest \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data "{
      \"name\": \"Low disk space\",
      \"avatar\": \"ðŸ’½\",
      \"notify\": \"true\",
      \"content\": \"Disk space is below threshold on $(hostname): only $((100 - USAGE))% remaining\"
    }"
fi
```

Going further, you can also set a crontab that runs this script every day.

### Conclusion

Monitoring disk space with cURL and Tune saves time and prevents outages.
Tune handles your alerts in one dashboard and sends push notifications to your device.
