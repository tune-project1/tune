## Why monitor disk space with cURL

Disk space can fill up quickly and cause apps to fail or slow down. Sending regular usage metrics helps you spot issues before they impact users. For example, if your root partition hits 90 percent, you can trigger an alert and free up space.

Using cURL to send these metrics means you can schedule checks in a cron job or run them inside a container without extra dependencies.

## Track disk space with Tune

Tune is a lightweight event tracking service. It lets you send metrics, errors, and alerts from any tech stack. You can view live dashboards, set up thresholds, and get notifications when things go wrong.

With Tune you can:

- Send custom events or metrics in seconds
- Build real-time dashboards without code
- Set up alerts on any event or data point

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create a free account.
2. In the dashboard, click on **API Keys** and copy your secret key.
3. Store the key in an environment variable named `OPS_API_KEY`.
4. Verify your setup by running a test event in the playground.

## Sending disk space metrics with cURL

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get disk usage for the root partition
USAGE=$(df --output=pcent / | tail -1 | tr -dc '0-9')

# Send the metric to Tune
curl -X POST "https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "disk usage",
    "avatar": "ðŸ’½",
    "content": "Disk usage at '$USAGE'% on /dev/sda1"
  }'
```

This script fetches the current usage of `/dev/sda1` and posts it to Tune. You can run it every five minutes in cron to keep your dashboard updated.

## Conclusion

Tune saves you time by handling event ingestion, dashboards, and alerts in one place. You can focus on your infrastructure instead of building a custom monitoring tool.
