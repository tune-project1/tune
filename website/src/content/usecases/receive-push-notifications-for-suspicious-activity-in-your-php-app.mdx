## What this article covers

This article shows how to get instant push notifications when your PHP app spots suspicious behavior. You might track repeated login failures, odd IP addresses or sudden spikes in password resets.

Real-time alerts help you react fast and stop attacks early.

## What is Tune

Tune is an event tracking tool for developers.

You log key actions as events and send them to Tune.

It stores, groups and notifies you about events in real time.

You can use it to track and alert on security issues in any app.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to the sign up page at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. In your project settings, copy your read key. This is your API key.
3. Keep the key safe. You will use it to send events from your PHP app.

## Code snippet

Below is a PHP example using Guzzle to send different suspicious activity events to Tune.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client();
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Example 1: Suspicious login attempts
$payload1 = [
  'key' => $apiKey,
  'body' => [
    'name' => 'Suspicious login attempt',
    'avatar' => '🚨',
    'content' => 'Multiple failed login attempts detected for user john.smith'
  ]
];

$client->post('https://api.tune/event-ingest', [
  'json' => $payload1
]);

// Example 2: Unusual geolocation access
$payload2 = [
  'key' => $apiKey,
  'body' => [
    'name' => 'Unusual geolocation',
    'avatar' => '🌍',
    'content' => 'User jane.doe accessed account from Russia'
  ]
];

$client->post('https://api.tune/event-ingest', [
  'json' => $payload2
]);

// Example 3: Excessive password resets
$payload3 = [
  'key' => $apiKey,
  'body' => [
    'name' => 'Multiple password resets',
    'avatar' => '🔑',
    'content' => 'User john.smith requested 5 reset emails in 2 minutes'
  ]
];

$client->post('https://api.tune/event-ingest', [
  'json' => $payload3
]);
```

Each snippet sends a different event to Tune. You will get push alerts when these calls happen.

## Conclusion

Using Tune for security alerts saves you time and worry. You can centralize tracking, get instant notifications and act quickly.
