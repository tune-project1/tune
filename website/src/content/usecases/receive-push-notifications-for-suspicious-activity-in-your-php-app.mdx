## What is suspicious activity monitoring in PHP?

Monitoring suspicious activity in your PHP application means detecting events like failed logins, unusual file access, or SQL injection attempts.

When you receive instant push notifications, you can react quickly to potential security breaches.

For example, if someone tries to log in with the wrong password multiple times, you get an alert and can investigate before damage happens.

## Track events with Tune

Tune is an open source event-tracking tool you can use to send and view security events from any tech stack.

It lets you define events, add avatars, and push notifications instantly when something unusual happens.

## Setting up Tune

Follow these steps to start tracking suspicious events:

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy the project API key under Settings.
4. Install the PHP SDK with Composer:
   ```
   composer require tune/tune
   ```
5. Add your API key to your environment as `OPERATIONAL_API_KEY`.

## Code examples for suspicious events

The following examples show how to send different security alerts to Tune.

### 1. Suspicious login attempt
This snippet sends an event when failed logins exceed a threshold.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune(getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY'));

$payload = [
    'name' => 'suspicious login attempt',
    'avatar' => '🔒',
    'content' => 'Multiple failed login attempts detected for user John Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

### 2. Unauthorized file access
This example alerts when someone tries to read a protected file.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune(getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY'));

$payload = [
    'name' => 'unauthorized file access',
    'avatar' => '📁',
    'content' => 'User with ID 123 tried to access config.php without permission'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

### 3. SQL injection attempt
Send an alert when input patterns match injection signatures.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune(getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY'));

$payload = [
    'name' => 'sql injection detected',
    'avatar' => '🛡️',
    'content' => 'Possible SQL injection from IP 203.0.113.5 on login form'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

### 4. Suspicious IP address
Alert when a blocked IP tries to connect.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune(getenv('OPERATIONAL_API_KEY'));

$payload = [
    'name' => 'suspicious IP address',
    'avatar' => '🌐',
    'content' => 'Connection attempt from blacklisted IP 198.51.100.22'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
