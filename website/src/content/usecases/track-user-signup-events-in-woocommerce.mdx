## What is user signup tracking in WooCommerce?

Tracking user signup events in WooCommerce helps you monitor new customers.
You can send these events to a central service for analysis.
This gives insight into signup trends and helps you spot issues early.

### Introducing Tune for tracking events

Tune is an open source service to collect and view events from any application.
You can send signup events from WooCommerce and watch them in a dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep your key safe for your application.

### Instrumenting signup events in WooCommerce

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\\Tune;

// Initialize the SDK with your API key
$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Signup',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸŽ‰',
  'content' => 'John Smith signed up with email john@example.com'
];

// Send the event to Tune
$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code captures a new user signup and sends it to Tune.

### Conclusion

Using Tune saves time and reduces setup hassle.
You get a live view of user signups without building your own system.
