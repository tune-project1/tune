## What this article is about

Managing environment variables is key to keeping your Node.js server secure and reliable. When you know which keys are loaded, you avoid runtime errors.

For example, if your database URL or API keys are missing, your application can crash unexpectedly.

## Using Tune to track environment variables

Tune is a lightweight event-tracking tool. You can send custom events whenever your server loads or updates its configuration.

With Tune, you get a clear view of which environment variables are set in production, staging, or development. This helps you spot missing or incorrect values before they cause errors.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new project or use an existing one.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.

You‚Äôll use this key to send events from your Node.js server.

## Code example for viewing env vars

This example shows how to send an event with key environment variables right after your server starts. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "View environment variables",
  avatar: "üóù",
  content: "Loaded environment variables: DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db, NODE_ENV=production"
};

async function reportEnv() {
  try {
    await ops.events.ingest(payload);
    console.log("Environment variables sent to Tune");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to send env vars", err);
  }
}

reportEnv();
```

This code imports the Tune SDK, creates an event with your key settings, and sends it when your server starts. You‚Äôll see the event in your Tune dashboard.

## Conclusion

Using Tune to track environment variables saves you time and prevents configuration-related bugs.

You can quickly identify missing keys or incorrect values. Learn more at https://tune and try the live snippets in the playground: https://tune/playground
