# What is viewing user's profile data

In a SaaS product, showing a user their profile data helps with personalization and user engagement.

Tracking when users view their profile can give you insights into feature usage.

You might add a log when John Smith opens his account page to see his details.

# Use Tune to track profile views

Tune is an event tracking tool you can use to capture user actions in real time.

It lets you send events from your app to a dashboard for monitoring and analysis.

# Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Log in and copy your API key from the settings page.
3. Install the SDK in your project by running `npm install @tune/sdk`.
4. Initialize the client with your API key.

# Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "viewed profile",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "John Smith viewed his profile page"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This snippet sends an event each time a user views their profile in your SaaS application.

# Conclusion

Tune saves you time by handling event ingestion and dashboards out of the box.
