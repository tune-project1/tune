## What this article covers

In a SaaS product, spotting suspicious activity early can protect your users and data. Real-time alerts help you respond to brute-force logins, password spraying, or unusual IP access.

This guide shows how to send push notifications for suspicious events using Tune.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking service. You can record user actions, errors, or security events and forward them to any tool or channel. It makes it easy to catch and act on suspicious behavior in your application.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Navigate to your workspace settings to find your API key.
3. Copy the key and keep it handy for your code.

## Code examples

Below are JavaScript examples of pushing suspicious activity events to Tune.

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Example 1: Suspicious login attempts
const payload1 = {
  name: "suspicious login attempt",
  avatar: "üîî",
  content: "Multiple failed login attempts for user John Smith"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload1)

// Example 2: Unusual IP address access
const payload2 = {
  name: "unusual IP access",
  avatar: "üö®",
  content: "User Jane Doe signed in from an unknown IP 203.0.113.42"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload2)

// Example 3: Possible data export
const payload3 = {
  name: "large data export",
  avatar: "‚ö†Ô∏è",
  content: "User Acme Corp exported 10,000 records"
}
await ops.events.ingest(payload3)
```

These snippets log different suspicious activities. Each event can trigger a push notification in your Tune workspace.

## Conclusion

By sending security events to Tune, you get instant push notifications for unusual activity. That helps you react faster and keep your SaaS secure.
