## Why track suspicious activity

Tracking suspicious activity helps you detect threats early.

For example, you may spot a sudden spike in login attempts or unusual data exports.

By sending instant alerts, your team can act before issues escalate.

### What is Tune and how it works

Tune is an open source event tracking tool.

It captures events in your product and routes them to your channels.

You can use it to trigger push notifications for key events.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for an account.
2. In the dashboard, create a new project and copy the API key.
3. Install the SDK in your app:
   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Initialize the client with your API key.

### Code snippet

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "Suspicious login detected",
  avatar: "ðŸ”’",
  content: "User John Smith logged in from a new device in Moscow"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example sends an event when a suspicious login occurs.
Tune captures the event and triggers your push notification.

### Conclusion

Tune saves you time and reduces manual work.

You get real-time alerts for threats in your SaaS product.
