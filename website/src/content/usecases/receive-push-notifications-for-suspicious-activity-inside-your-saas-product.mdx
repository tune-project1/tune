## Understanding push alerts for suspicious activity in SaaS

Detecting and responding to unusual behavior in your SaaS app helps prevent fraud and protect user data.

For example, if a user logs in from an unrecognized IP address or makes repeated failed login attempts, you want to know right away.

This article shows how to send real-time push notifications when such events occur.

## What is Tune and how it helps

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool that captures events from your app and routes them to your dashboard.

You can monitor key actions and set up alerts for events like failed logins, data exports, or permission changes.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project by clicking "New Project" in your dashboard.
3. Open the project settings and copy your API key.
4. Install the SDK in your codebase using your preferred package manager.

## Code example: Tracking suspicious login attempts

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "suspicious login attempt",
  avatar: "ðŸš¨",
  content: "User John Smith logged in from unknown IP 203.0.113.45"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This snippet sends an event to Tune whenever a user logs in from an unrecognized IP address.

## Conclusion

Using Tune for tracking suspicious activity saves time and reduces security risks by sending instant push alerts.
