## Understanding Environment Variables in PHP

Environment variables hold configuration data outside your code. In PHP, they help you keep sensitive data like database credentials safe.

For example, instead of hardcoding a database password, you can store it in an env var and fetch it with `getenv('DB_PASS')`.

Using env vars makes your code more secure and easier to move between environments.

## Using Tune for Event Tracking

Tune is a simple tool to capture events in your applications. You can log actions like fetching env vars to monitor usage and detect issues.

With Tune you get a dashboard that shows every event in real time. Use it to understand how often users or systems read env vars without digging through logs.

## Setting Up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new API key under the **Settings** section.
3. Copy the API key and keep it safe.
4. You‚Äôre ready to send events from your PHP code.

## Tracking Env Var Views with PHP

```php
<?php
// Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  'name'   => 'view environment variables',
  'avatar' => 'üóùÔ∏è',
  'content'=> 'Fetched server env vars successfully'
];

// Initialize cURL
$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));

// Send the event
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

// Handle the response
if ($response === false) {
    echo "Failed to send event.";
} else {
    echo "Event sent successfully.";
}
```

This snippet sends an event to Tune when your PHP code reads environment variables.

## Conclusion

Using Tune, you can track how often your PHP application accesses environment variables. This helps you spot unexpected reads and maintain security.
