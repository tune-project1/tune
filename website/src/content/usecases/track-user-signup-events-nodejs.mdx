## What are user signup events in Node.js

User signup events capture when someone creates an account in your Node.js application. Tracking these events helps you understand user growth and conversion rates.

For example, when a customer registers on your e-commerce site, you can log their email and timestamp to monitor marketing campaign performance.

## Tracking signup events with Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool you can add to any tech product. It lets you capture actions like user signup and view them in real time.

With a few lines of code, you can send events to Tune and explore them in a dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and confirm your email.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the Node.js SDK:
   
   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```

## Code example: Tracking user signup events in Node.js

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "user_signup",
  avatar: "üìù",
  content: "John Smith signed up with email john@example.com"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```
This code logs a `user_signup` event with the user's name and email. Replace `API_KEY` with your key from the dashboard.

## Conclusion

Tracking user signup events with Tune saves you time and effort. You get real-time insights without building your own pipeline.
