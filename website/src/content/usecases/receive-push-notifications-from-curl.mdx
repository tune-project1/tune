## What is receiving push notifications with cURL

Push notifications help you stay informed when important events occur in your systems.

By using cURL, you can send a quick HTTP request to Tune and trigger an alert.

For example, you might notify your team when a server goes down or when an error spikes.

### Tracking events with Tune

Tune is an open-source tool for tracking and alerting on events in any product.

You can configure notification channels like email, Slack, or SMS.

When you send an event with cURL, Tune processes it and pushes notifications to your team.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key from the project settings.
3. Keep your API key handy for authenticating cURL requests.

### Sending notifications with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tune/events.ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High server load alert",
    "avatar": "ðŸ“ˆ",
    "content": "Server load exceeded 80% on server-1"
  }'
```

This cURL request sends a push notification event to Tune. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual token. Tune will deliver an alert to your configured channels.

### Conclusion

Using cURL with Tune lets you send push notifications in seconds.

Tune saves time by handling delivery and retries for you.
