## What is an audit log system in SaaS?

An audit log system records key actions that users or admins perform in your application.

It helps with debugging, security audits and compliance.

For example, when a user updates billing settings, you store a record of who did what and when.

### Using Tune to track audit events

Tune is an open-source tracking platform for tech products.

You can send events from your code and view them in a dashboard.

You can filter by event name, date or user. It helps you investigate issues faster.

### Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your project with npm install @tune/sdk.
4. Keep your API key safe and add it to your environment variables.

### Code examples

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

// Example 1: Account creation
const payload1 = {
  name: "account created",
  avatar: "✅",
  content: "User John Smith created a new account"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload1);

// Example 2: Password change
const payload2 = {
  name: "password changed",
  avatar: "🔒",
  content: "User Jane Doe updated her password"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload2);

// Example 3: Account deletion
const payload3 = {
  name: "account deleted",
  avatar: "🗑️",
  content: "User Mark Lee deleted their account"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload3);

// Example 4: Billing update
const payload4 = {
  name: "billing updated",
  avatar: "💳",
  content: "User Alex Kim changed billing information"
};
await ops.events.ingest(payload4);
```

This code shows how to send different audit events to Tune for tracking and review.

Tune saves time and hassle by handling event ingestion, storage and inspection.

You get a ready dashboard and filters to view your audit logs.
