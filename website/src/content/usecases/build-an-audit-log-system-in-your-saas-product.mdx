## What is an audit log system in SaaS?

An audit log system records key actions in your SaaS app.

For example, you can track when a user updates their billing plan or when an admin changes permissions.

This helps you monitor changes, meet compliance, and troubleshoot issues.

## Track actions with Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool.

It lets you send events like user actions and view them in a real-time dashboard.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key for use in your code.

## Code examples for audit logging

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload1 = {
  name: "audit_log",
  avatar: "📝",
  content: "User Jane Doe created a new account",
  metadata: {
    userId: 123,
    action: "create_account"
  }
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload1)
```

Example 1 logs when a new user signs up.

```javascript
const payload2 = {
  name: "audit_log",
  avatar: "📝",
  content: "Admin John Smith changed user role",
  metadata: {
    userId: 456,
    changedBy: "John Smith",
    action: "role_change"
  }
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload2)
```

Example 2 logs role updates.

```javascript
const payload3 = {
  name: "audit_log",
  avatar: "📝",
  content: "User Alice Lee updated billing info",
  metadata: {
    userId: 789,
    action: "update_billing"
  }
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload3)
```

Example 3 logs billing updates.
