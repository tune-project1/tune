## What this article is about

An audit log keeps a record of user actions in your SaaS app. It helps with security, debugging, and compliance.

For example, you can record when a user updates their billing info or deletes an account.

## What is Tune and how it can be used to track audit events

Tune is an open source toolkit for capturing events in any tech product.

You can log audit events with a simple API call.

It lets you view a timeline of actions and filter by user, event type, or date.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your code base.

## Code examples

```js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Track user login
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "user.login",
  avatar: "🔑",
  content: "User John Smith logged in to the dashboard"
})

// Track email update
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "user.update_email",
  avatar: "✉️",
  content: "User Jane Doe changed email from jane@example.com to jane@newmail.com"
})

// Track account deletion
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "user.delete_account",
  avatar: "🗑️",
  content: "User Alice Johnson deleted her account"
})

// Track permission change
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "user.change_role",
  avatar: "⚙️",
  content: "User Bob Lee was promoted to admin"
})
```

These examples show how to record key actions in your audit log.

## Conclusion

An audit log system gives you insights into user behavior and helps meet security and compliance needs.

Tune makes it easy to capture and view events without building a custom pipeline.
