## Why track billing events in PHP?

Tracking billing events in your PHP app helps you monitor payments and subscriptions.

For example, you can detect failed payments and notify customers immediately.

## What is Tune?

Tune is an open source event tracking solution.

It captures events from any tech product and gives you real-time insights.

You can use it to record billing events like payments, failures, and refunds.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and verify your email.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Go to Project Settings and copy your API key.
4. Keep the API key safe to use in your code.

## Code example

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'billing_success',
    'avatar' => '💳',
    'content' => 'Subscription payment completed for user Jane Doe'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This example sends a billing_success event when a subscription payment completes.

```php
<?php
// Track a failed payment
$payload = [
    'name' => 'billing_failed',
    'avatar' => '⚠️',
    'content' => 'Credit card declined for user John Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

```php
<?php
// Track a refund
$payload = [
    'name' => 'billing_refund',
    'avatar' => '🔙',
    'content' => 'Refund issued for user Alice Brown order #12345'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

Tune simplifies tracking billing logic in your PHP app.
