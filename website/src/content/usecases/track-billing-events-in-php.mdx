Tracking billing events in your PHP app helps you monitor payments and catch issues early.
You can record actions like invoice creation, successful payments, and payment failures.

## Introducing Tune

Tune is an open-source tool that lets you send and view events from any app.
You can log billing actions and see them in a dashboard or forward them to your alerts.
This helps you spot revenue problems and fix them faster.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.

## Code examples and conclusion

Example: Invoice Created

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'invoice_created',
    'avatar' => '💳',
    'content' => 'Invoice INV-1001 created for customer Jane Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
This sends an event when an invoice is created.

Example: Payment Succeeded

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'invoice_paid',
    'avatar' => '💳',
    'content' => 'Invoice INV-1001 paid by Jane Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
This logs a successful payment event.

Example: Payment Failed

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Tune\Tune;

$ops = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'payment_failed',
    'avatar' => '❌',
    'content' => 'Payment failed for invoice INV-1001 for customer Jane Smith'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```
This records a failed payment attempt.
