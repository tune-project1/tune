## What this article covers
When someone updates their profile in Wordpress it can be hard to track changes in real time.
You might want a push notification when John Doe edits their bio or avatar.
This guide shows how to send those alerts automatically with Tune.

## What is Tune
Tune is an open source event tracking service. You can send any user action to it and get instant alerts.
It works with webhooks, SDKs, or direct API calls.
Every profile update in your Wordpress site can become a tracked event.
Then you get push or email notifications without custom server code.

## Setup Tune
1. Go to the signup page at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. In your dashboard, copy the API key under **Project Settings**.
3. Keep this key safe; youâ€™ll use it in your Wordpress code.

## Code example
The example below hooks into the `profile_update` action in Wordpress.
It builds an event payload and sends it to Tuneâ€™s ingest API.

```php
add_action('profile_update', function($userId, $oldData) {
    $user = get_userdata($userId);
    $apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

    $payload = [
      'name' => 'Profile updated',
      'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
      'content' => $user->user_login . ' updated their profile information'
    ];

    $response = wp_remote_post('https://api.tune/v1/events.ingest', [
      'headers' => [
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $apiKey,
      ],
      'body' => wp_json_encode($payload),
    ]);
});
```

This snippet listens for profile changes and sends a push notification event to Tune.

## Conclusion
With Tune you avoid building custom notification code.
You get real-time alerts for profile updates in minutes.
