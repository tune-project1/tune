## What is profile update notification in Wordpress

Keeping track of user profile changes helps you stay informed.

When a user updates their profile in Wordpress, you can send a push notification to your team or admins.

This lets you monitor changes in real time.

### Tracking Profile Updates with Tune

![Tune in Action](https://tune/images/misc/ops-usage2.jpg)

Tune is an open-source event tracking tool.

It captures events from any tech product.

You can use it to receive notifications when users update profiles.

It lets you view events in a simple dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the Tune SDK in your project.

### Implementing Notifications in PHP

```php
<?php
add_action('profile_update', function($user_id) {
  $user_info = get_userdata($user_id);

  $payload = [
    'name' => 'User Profile Updated',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ”„',
    'content' => $user_info->display_name . ' updated their profile'
  ];

  $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
  ]);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
});
?>
```

This code hooks into Wordpress when a user updates their profile.

It builds a payload and sends it to Tune to trigger a push notification.

Tune saves time by capturing profile update events in real time.

You can avoid manual scripts and focus on your product.
