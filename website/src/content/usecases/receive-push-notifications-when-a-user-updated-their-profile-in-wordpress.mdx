## What are user profile update notifications in Wordpress

Receiving push notifications when a user updates their profile helps administrators stay informed of changes.
For example, you can be alerted when a user updates their bio or contact information.

## Using Tune for tracking profile updates

Tune is a tool for collecting and monitoring events in your applications.
It can send real-time notifications when significant actions occur.

With Tune you can track profile updates from Wordpress and get push notifications instantly.

## Setup Tune for Wordpress

Follow these steps to connect your Wordpress site to Tune:

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install or update your site's dependencies to use PHP and Guzzle.
4. Store your API key in a secure location, like an environment variable.

## Tracking profile updates in Wordpress with PHP

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\\Client;

function notifyProfileUpdate($user_id, $user_name) {
    $client = new Client([
        'base_uri' => 'https://api.tune',
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ],
    ]);

    $payload = [
        'name' => 'User Profile Updated',
        'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
        'content' => "{$user_name} updated their profile",
        'properties' => [
            'user_id' => $user_id,
            'user_name' => $user_name,
        ],
    ];

    $client->post('/events', ['json' => $payload]);
}

add_action('profile_update', function($user_id, $old_user_data) {
    $user = get_userdata($user_id);
    notifyProfileUpdate($user_id, $user->user_login);
}, 10, 2);
```

This code hooks into Wordpress's profile_update action and sends a notification to Tune when a user updates their profile.
