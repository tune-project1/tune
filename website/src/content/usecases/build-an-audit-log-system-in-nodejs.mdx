## What is audit logging in Node.js

Audit logging records important actions in your application.

For example, tracking when a user updates their email helps with security and debugging.

An audit log shows who did what and when in your system.

### Using Tune for Audit Logging

Tune is an open source event tracking tool.

You can use it to send structured audit events from your Node.js app.

### Setting Up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project for your audit logs.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Store the key as an environment variable in your app.

### Example Code

Below are examples of tracking audit events in Node.js.

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY)

const payload = {
  name: 'User created',
  avatar: '📝',
  content: 'User John Smith created an account'
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY)

const payload = {
  name: 'Profile updated',
  avatar: '📝',
  content: 'User Jane Doe updated email from jane@old.com to jane@new.com'
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY)

const payload = {
  name: 'Permission changed',
  avatar: '📝',
  content: 'Admin Mark changed role of user Alice to moderator'
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

```javascript
import Tune from '@tune/sdk'
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY)

const payload = {
  name: 'File deleted',
  avatar: '📝',
  content: 'User Bob deleted report Q2_financials.pdf'
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

Each snippet shows how to send a different audit event to Tune.
