## What it means to view environment variables inside a SaaS product

Environment variables store configuration details on your server.
Being able to view them inside your SaaS dashboard can help with debugging.
You can spot misconfigurations without SSH access.
For example, you might check database host and credentials when an app fails to connect.

### Introducing Tune for environment variable visibility

Tune is an open source event tracking tool.
You can send snapshots of your environment variables as events.
This lets you view them in your Tune dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Visit [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for a free account.
2. Log in and go to the API Keys section.
3. Create a new API key and copy it for later.
4. Install the Tune SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```

### Sending environment variables to Tune

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "env_vars_snapshot",
  avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
  content: "Production environment variables: DB_HOST=prod-db.example.com, DB_USER=admin, SECRET_KEY=secret123"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends a snapshot of your server environment variables to Tune.

### Conclusion

Viewing environment variables inside a SaaS dashboard saves time and hassle.
You avoid SSH access and speed up debugging.
