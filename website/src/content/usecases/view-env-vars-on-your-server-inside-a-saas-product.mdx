# 1. What this article is about

Viewing environment variables on your server can help you debug and audit sensitive settings in a SaaS product.
Tracking who accessed variables and when is key to keeping your system transparent.

# 2. What is Tune and how to use it to track env var views

Tune is a tool that collects and displays event data from your application.
You can send custom events when someone requests an environment variable.
Those events appear in dashboards and timelines in your Tune workspace.

# 3. Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project and find your API key on the project settings page.
3. Install the @tune/sdk in your codebase.

# 4. Code snippet

This example shows how to log an event each time your app reads an environment variable.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("API_KEY");

function viewEnvVar(key) {
  const value = process.env[key];

  const payload = {
    name: "view env var",
    avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
    content: `User fetched environment variable ${key}`,
    properties: {
      key: key,
      value: value
    }
  };

  ops.events.ingest(payload);
  return value;
}

// Example usage
const dbUrl = viewEnvVar("DATABASE_URL");
console.log("DB URL is", dbUrl);
```

This code reads the requested variable, sends an event to Tune, and returns the value.

# 5. Conclusion

Using Tune to track environment variable access saves you time and helps you catch misconfigurations.
You get a clear audit trail without building your own logging UI.
