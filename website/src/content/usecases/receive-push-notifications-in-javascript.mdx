## Overview

In this article, we explain how tracking push notifications received in your JavaScript app can help you monitor delivery success and user engagement. For example, you might want to know when a marketing alert reaches a userâ€™s browser.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking service. It lets you send structured events from any tech product for real-time logging and analysis. With a simple JavaScript SDK, you can record each push notification receipt and view it on the Tune dashboard. This helps you spot failed deliveries and measure engagement.

## Setup Tune

1. Visit [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for an account.
2. In your dashboard, create a new project and copy the API key.
3. Install the SDK in your project:  
   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Keep your API key handy for the code example.

## Code example

```javascript
// app.js
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Register your service worker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered'));
}

// sw.js (your service worker file)
importScripts('https://cdn.tune/sdk.js');

const swOps = new Tune('YOUR_API_KEY');

self.addEventListener('push', async event => {
  const data = event.data.json();
  const payload = {
    name: "push notification received",
    avatar: "ðŸ””",
    content: `Notification titled '${data.title}' received`
  };

  await swOps.events.ingest(payload);
});
```

This code shows how to send an event to Tune each time your service worker handles a push notification. You register the worker, listen for the `push` event, and then log the receipt with `events.ingest`.

## Conclusion

By tracking push notification receipts with Tune, you get instant visibility into delivery rates and user engagement without building your own logging system. Learn more at https://tune and try out our [playground](https://tune/playground) to copy and paste code snippets for your project.
