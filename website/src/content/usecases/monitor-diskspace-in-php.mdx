## Why monitor disk space in PHP

Running out of disk space can break your PHP applications. Logs stop writing. Backups fail. Uploads error out. Monitoring disk space helps you catch these issues early. For example, a cron job writing backups may silently fail when the server runs out of room.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking tool. You can send events from any code. It stores and displays them in a clean dashboard. Use it to alert your team when something goes wrong.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your PHP project with Composer.

## Tracking disk space in PHP

Install the SDK:

```bash
composer require tune/sdk
```

Then use this script to check disk space and send an alert:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Tune\Tune;

// Replace with your project API key
$ops = new Tune('API_KEY');

// Check disk usage
$path = '/';
$freeBytes = disk_free_space($path);
$totalBytes = disk_total_space($path);
$freePercent = round($freeBytes / $totalBytes * 100, 2);

// Prepare event payload
$payload = [
    'name' => 'Disk space low',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ’¾',
    'content' => "Server has only {$freePercent}% disk space left",
];

// Send event to Tune
$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code calculates available disk space on the root path. It then sends an event to Tune when free space is low.
