## What is disk space monitoring in PHP

Monitoring disk space in PHP helps avoid server failures when storage runs out.

For example, log files or uploads can fill up a drive and cause errors.
You can use PHP to check free space and notify before it becomes critical.

## Using Tune to track disk space issues

Tune offers a simple API to log events from any app.

It stores your events, runs alerts, and gives insights into system health.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up.
2. Create a new project and get your API key.
3. Install any HTTP client library in PHP if needed.
4. Keep your API key safe.

## PHP code example for disk space monitoring

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$payload = [
    'name' => 'Low disk space',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ’¾',
    'content' => 'Disk space fell below 15% on server host01'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/v1/events/ingest');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    "Authorization: Bearer {$apiKey}"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This example checks disk space and sends an event to Tune when usage is low.

## Conclusion

Using Tune saves time and hassle by handling event ingestion and alerting.
