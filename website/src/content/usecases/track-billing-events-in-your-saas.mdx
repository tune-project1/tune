## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform for any tech product.

It lets you send structured events like errors, user actions, or billing updates.

You can then view these events in a dashboard or integrate with other tools.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and get your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your code:

```bash
npm install @tune/sdk
```

4. Store your API key in an environment variable:

```bash
export OP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Code examples for tracking billing events

These examples show how to send different billing events.

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune(process.env.OP_API_KEY)

// Invoice created event
const invoiceCreated = {
  name: "invoice created",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "Invoice #123 created for $49.99 by John Doe"
}
await ops.events.ingest(invoiceCreated)

// Payment succeeded event
const paymentSucceeded = {
  name: "payment succeeded",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "Invoice #123 paid successfully by John Doe"
}
await ops.events.ingest(paymentSucceeded)

// Payment failed event
const paymentFailed = {
  name: "payment failed",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "Payment for invoice #124 failed for Jane Smith"
}
await ops.events.ingest(paymentFailed)
```

Each example sends a billing event to Tune so you can monitor your revenue flow.

Tune saves you time and hassle by letting you track billing events without building your own system.
