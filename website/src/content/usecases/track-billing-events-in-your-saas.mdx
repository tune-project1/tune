## What is billing event tracking in SaaS
Tracking billing events means capturing actions like payments, failures, or subscription changes.
It helps you monitor revenue flow and detect issues fast.
For example, if a customer card fails, you can alert support and retry the charge.

### Why use Tune for billing events
Tune is a lightweight tracking tool for any event in your app.
You can send billing events to its dashboard and see them in real time.

  content: "Subscription billed for $20 for John Smith"
});

// Billing failure event
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "billing_failure",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
