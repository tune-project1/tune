## What this article is about

An audit log helps you track important actions in your PHP application.
You can record who did what and when it happened.
For example, if an administrator changes a user’s role, you can save that event to review later.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking system.
It lets you send custom events from your code and view them in a simple dashboard.
You can use it to build audit logs by sending structured events for each action you want to record.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up.
2. Create a new project and note your API key.
3. Use the API key in your PHP code to send events.

## Code examples

Here are four examples of audit events you can send from your PHP app.

### 1. Recording account creation

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'account created',
  'avatar' => '🆕',
  'content' => 'New user John Doe signed up with email john@example.com'
];

$ch = curl_init("https://api.tune/v1/events/structured?key=$apiKey");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'POST');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Content-Type: application/json']);
curl_exec($ch);
```  
This snippet logs when a new user account is created.

### 2. Recording role changes

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'role changed',
  'avatar' => '⚙️',
  'content' => 'Admin Jane Doe changed role for user John Smith from editor to moderator'
];

// send the event
echo "Sending role change event...";
```  
Logs when an admin updates a user’s role.

### 3. Recording data exports

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'data export',
  'avatar' => '📤',
  'content' => 'User John Smith exported order data for March 2025'
];

// send the event
echo "Logging data export...";
```  
Tracks when a user exports data from the system.

### 4. Recording order updates

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'order status updated',
  'avatar' => '✅',
  'content' => 'User Alice updated order #12345 status to shipped'
];

// send the event
echo "Logging order update...";
```  
Captures changes to order status for auditing.
