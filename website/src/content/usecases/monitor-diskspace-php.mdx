## Why monitor disk space in PHP

Monitoring disk space in your PHP application helps prevent server failures.

When disk usage hits critical levels your app can break or logs can be lost.

Detecting low disk space early keeps your service running smoothly.

### What is Tune

Tune is an open source event tracking system.

You can send custom events or metrics to Tune for real time insights.

Use it to track disk space alerts and stay ahead of issues.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new project for your application.
3. Copy the API key from your project settings.

### Tracking disk space events in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = "API_KEY";

$payload = [
  "name" => "Disk space low",
  "avatar" => "ðŸ’¾",
  "content" => "Server disk space at 10% on /var/www"
];

$ch = curl_init("https://api.tune/events.ingest");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  "Content-Type: application/json",
  "Authorization: Bearer $apiKey",
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

This snippet checks disk usage and sends an event to Tune when space is low.

### Conclusion

Using Tune saves time and effort by centralizing disk space alerts.
