## Why monitor disk space in Node.js

Running a Node.js server means files and logs grow over time.
If disk space fills up, your app can crash or slow down.
Monitoring usage ahead of time helps avoid outages.

For example, you can send an alert when free space drops below a threshold.
This helps ops teams act before users see errors.

## What is Tune

Tune is a simple event tracking service.
You can send custom events for errors, performance or usage.

Each event shows up in a dashboard with filters and alerts.
You get real-time visibility into key metrics.

## Setting up Tune

First, sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).

After you verify your email, create a new project.
Copy the API key from your project settings.

You will use that key to send events from your Node.js code.

## Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk";

const ops = new Tune("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function checkDiskSpace() {
  // simulate fetching disk stats
  const free = 20; // in GB
  const total = 100; // in GB
  const usedPercent = Math.round(((total - free) / total) * 100);

  if (usedPercent > 80) {
    const payload = {
      name: "High disk usage",
      avatar: "🗄️",
      content: `Disk usage at ${usedPercent}% on server1.`,
      tags: ["diskspace", "alert"]
    };

    await ops.events.ingest(payload);
  }
}

checkDiskSpace();
```

In this example, the script checks disk space on a server.
If usage goes above 80%, it sends an event to Tune.

## Conclusion

Using Tune for disk space alerts saves time and avoids surprises.
You get visual dashboards and notifications without building your own system.
