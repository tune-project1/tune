## What is viewing user's profile data in Node.js

Fetching and displaying a user's profile data is a common task in web apps.

You might need to show a userâ€™s name, email, or avatar on a dashboard or settings page.

Handling this in Node.js lets you integrate with databases or external APIs to deliver dynamic content.

## Using Tune to track profile views

Tune is an open-source tool for capturing events in your application.

You can use it to log when a user views their profile, which helps you understand user engagement.

When a profile is loaded, send an event to Tune to record the action.

## Setting up Tune

1. Go to [app.tune](https://app.tune) and sign up for an account.
2. In the dashboard, generate a new API key for your project.
3. In your Node.js app, install the SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```
4. Store your API key in an environment variable, for example:

   ```bash
   export OPERATIONAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Code snippet: Tracking profile views

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

const ops = new Tune(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY)

async function viewUserProfile(userId) {
  // Simulate fetching user data
  const user = { id: userId, name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com" }

  // Track profile view event
  await ops.events.ingest({
    name: "view profile",
    avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
    content: `User ${user.name} viewed`,
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      email: user.email
    }
  })

  return user
}

// Example usage
viewUserProfile(123)
  .then(profile => console.log(profile))
  .catch(err => console.error(err))
```

This code fetches a user's profile data and sends a "view profile" event to Tune.

## Conclusion

Tracking profile views in your Node.js app helps you monitor user activity and improve engagement.

Tune makes it easy to record these events without building your own tracking system.
