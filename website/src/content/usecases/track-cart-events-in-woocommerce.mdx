## What this article is about

Tracking when customers add or remove items from their WooCommerce cart helps you understand shopping behavior and improve conversion rates. For example, you might see that many shoppers add a Blue T-Shirt but never check out. By sending these events to Tune, you can spot drop-off points and test new strategies.

## What is Tune

Tune is a simple, developer-friendly platform for capturing events from your app or website. Instead of building and maintaining your own tracking backend, you send event data to Tune. You can then analyze these events in real time, set up alerts, and share insights with your team.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and verify your email.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key from the project settings.
3. Add the API key to your WooCommerce plugin or theme files.

## Code examples

Below are two PHP snippets. The first tracks when a product is added to the cart. The second tracks when a product is removed.

```php
// Track product added to cart
add_action('woocommerce_add_to_cart', function($cart_item_key, $product_id, $quantity) {
    $apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    $payload = [
        'name' => 'Product added to cart',
        'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
        'content' => "John Smith added Blue T-Shirt to cart",
        'properties' => [
            'productId' => $product_id,
            'quantity' => $quantity
        ]
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        'Content-Type: application/json',
        'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
}, 10, 3);
```

```php
// Track product removed from cart
add_action('woocommerce_remove_cart_item', function($cart_item_key, $cart) {
    $apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    $removed = $cart->removed_cart_contents[$cart_item_key];
    $productName = $removed['data']->get_name();
    $quantity = $removed['quantity'];

    $payload = [
        'name' => 'Product removed from cart',
        'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
        'content' => "Sarah Lee removed $productName from cart",
        'properties' => [
            'productId' => $removed['product_id'],
            'quantity' => $quantity
        ]
    ];

    $ch = curl_init('https://api.tune/events/ingest');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        'Content-Type: application/json',
        'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
}, 10, 2);
```

These snippets send cart events to Tune so you can monitor how users interact with products in real time.
