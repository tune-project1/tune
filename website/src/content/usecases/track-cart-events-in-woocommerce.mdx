## What is cart event tracking in WooCommerce

Tracking cart events lets you record when customers add items to their cart.
This insight can help you improve product recommendations and marketing.
For example, you can see which items are most often added and follow up with customers who abandon their carts.

### Introducing Tune

Tune is an open-source service for capturing events in any application.
You can send cart updates to its dashboard for easy monitoring.
It gives you real-time analytics without building your own event pipeline.

### Setup Tune

2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install Guzzle HTTP client in your project:
   ```
   composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
   ```

### Tracking cart events in WooCommerce (PHP)

```php
<?php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

// Listen for add to cart events
add_action('woocommerce_add_to_cart', function($cart_item_key, $product_id, $quantity) {
    $apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    $client = new Client();

    $userName = wp_get_current_user()->display_name;
    $productName = wc_get_product($product_id)->get_name();

    $payload = [
        'name'    => 'Cart Updated',
        'avatar'  => 'ðŸ›’',
        'content' => sprintf(
            '%s added %dx %s to cart',
            $userName,
            $quantity,
            $productName
        )
    ];

    $client->post('https://api.tune/events', [
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $apiKey,
            'Content-Type'  => 'application/json'
        ],
        'json' => $payload
    ]);
});
```

This code listens for add to cart events in WooCommerce.
It builds a payload with the user name, quantity, and product name.
Then it sends the event to Tune using an HTTP POST request.
