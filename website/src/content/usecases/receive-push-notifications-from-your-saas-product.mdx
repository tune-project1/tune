## Why push notifications matter

Push notifications keep your users engaged by delivering real-time updates.

For example, you can notify a user when a new message arrives in your app.

## Tracking notifications with Tune

Tune is a simple event tracking platform.

You can log notification events and monitor delivery status.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune) and create an account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your application: `npm install @tune/sdk`.
5. Initialize the SDK with your API key.

## Code example

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "push notification sent",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "Sent welcome notification to user ID 1234"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code initializes the Tune client, creates a payload for a push notification event, and sends it to Tune.

## Conclusion

Tune lets you track push notifications with minimal setup.

It saves time by handling event ingestion and monitoring.
