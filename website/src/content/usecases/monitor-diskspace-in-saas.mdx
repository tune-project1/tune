## What is disk space monitoring in SaaS

Monitoring disk space helps keep your SaaS running smoothly.

If disk space runs out, your service might stop storing data or crash.

For example, if your production database server runs out of space, you might lose user uploads.

### Using Tune for disk space monitoring

Tune is a lightweight event tracking tool for any application.

It lets you send events when disk space crosses thresholds and view them in a dashboard.

### Setting up Tune

1. Go to https://app.tune and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Navigate to project settings and copy your API key.
4. Install the Tune SDK in your application.

### Tracking disk space with code

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "Disk space low",
  avatar: "ðŸ’¾",
  content: "Server Alpha is below 10% disk space"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code checks your disk usage and sends an event to Tune when space gets low.

### Conclusion

Tune makes it easy to monitor disk space in your SaaS and get alerts before problems arise.
