## What this article is about

Handling push notifications from your Node.js backend helps you alert users in real time. For example, you might notify a mobile app when a new message arrives.

This guide shows how to capture and send push notification events using Tune.

## What is Tune

Tune is an open-source event tracking platform. You can send events from any tech stack and view them on a simple dashboard.

Use it to log errors, user actions, or push notifications. Events appear instantly so you can monitor system health in real time.

## Setting up Tune

1. Sign up at [app.tune](https://app.tune).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:

   ```bash
   npm install @tune/sdk
   ```

Youâ€™re now ready to send events.

## Code snippet

```javascript
import Tune from "@tune/sdk"

// Initialize with your API key
const ops = new Tune("API_KEY")

// Define a push notification event
const payload = {
  name: "push notification",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "New message for John Doe"
}

// Send the event to Tune
await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This example logs a push notification event each time your backend sends an alert. You can adjust the `content` field to include different user names or message details.

## Conclusion

Using Tune for push notifications saves time and reduces complexity. You get a live view of every event and can troubleshoot issues faster.
