# Wordpress plugin

## Installation

Use the [Wordpress plugin registry](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/tune/) to install the plugin.


After installing the plugin, click on Tune's settings in the sidebar.

Then enter your api key.

## Custom events

By default, the plugin will log simple login activity.

However the true strength of Tune is in sending custom events tailored towards your Wordpress installation.

Here's a example of sending a custom event via code.

```php
// Paste this inside your functions.php file
use function Tune\ops;

$response = ops([
  'name' => 'custom event',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ˜ƒ',
  'notify' => true // Optional, sends a push notification
]);
```

Read more about the events API [here](/api/introduction).

## For self hosters

Pass your backend's url in the 'base url' field inside plugin settings after installing the plugin.

You can find this url inside your self hosted instance's profile page under your api key.
