# Categories

Once you start receiving events, your main feed will be super dense.

Use categories to group events by their usecase.

## Example


<Item client:only="vue" 
  item={{
    name: "a critical event",
    avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
    createdAt: "2021-03-03",
    category : "error"
  }}
></Item>

```js
const e = {
  name: "a critical event",
  avatar: "ðŸ¤–",
  category : "error"
};
```


After sending this event, a "error" category will show up under the search bar inside the webapp UI.

Clicking on this will show you events which match the "error" category.

You can now filter events by the 'error' category through the search bar inside Tune. Click on the dropdown next to the search bar and your categories will show up.
