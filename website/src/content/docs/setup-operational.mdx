# Setup Tune

ðŸ‘‹Welcome to Tune!

This guide assumes you've signed up for a Tune account.

## Setting up your project

Once you signup, you'll be asked to create a project.

All your events, teammates, billing etc will be tied to the project.

In the near future, you can create additional projects too.

## API key

Once your project is created, you will be given an API key.
Keep this somewhere safe, ideally inside a `.env` file in your project.

## Sending your first event

Copy and paste this snippet inside chrome devtools:

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api.tune";
const event = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "ðŸ¤—",
  content: "Someone signed up",
}

const apikey = ''; // <- Enter your API key here

const headers = {
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${apikey}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/v1/ingest`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(event)
}).catch((err) => {});
```

Don't forget to enter your API key in the `apikey` var.

Running this inside chrome devtools(or any javascript environment) will send an event to Tune.

That's all to it!

## API key auth

You need to pass your api key as a bearer token.

```bash
Bearer API_KEY
```

For auth with our Nodejs SDK, see its dedicated page.

### Playground

Writing events can be tediuous so we created a Playground section inside the webapp. Go to [app.tune/playground](https://app.tune/playground) and copy-paste event code.

### Integrations

We have a [Nodejs SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tune/sdk) available.

Other integrations will be added as we work on them.
