# Install on Render.com

You can setup Tune on [render.com](https://render.com). This requires you to create:

- A static site(for /app)
- A nodejs webservice(for /backend)
- And a standalone mysql database

### Good to know

- The nodejs instance doesn't need much ram/cpu. You'll be fine with the $7 p/m plan for a looong time.
- Mysql db can be upgraded if you store a lot of events. Or you can modify the <a href="/selfhosted/setup-env">REMOVE_EVENTS_AFTER</a> env var to something shorter(its set up to store events for at least 1 year)
