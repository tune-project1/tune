# Durability testing

Tune has been tested successfully for upto 2 million events on a basic $5 VPS on hetzner.

Here's how we conducted the test and the results we got.

## Server type

The server we took out for testing was a Hetzner CAX11 https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/

This has 2 VCPUs, 4GB ram and 40gb ssd. We deployed Tune using the [VPS method](install-on-vps).

Mysql was used as the event store(default with self-hosted)

## Nature of the test

We setup another server which would continously pump events to the test server. There were a template of 6 events, one of which was a Stripe based webhook.

This test ran continously for 5 days and at the end, test server has accumulated more than 2 million events(2314636).

This meant the test server receive 19,288 events per hours, or 321 events per minute.

## Results

My primary concern were read speeds.

- When browsing the test server, there was no noticeable delay.
- Category filters worked great.
- New events would be added every few seconds, just as intended.
- Scrolling would load events fine.
- Search wasn't working(existing bug)

Here are the queries I used:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM Events;
```
= 2314636

```sql
SELECT
table_schema AS Database,
SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 AS Size (MB)
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'tune'
GROUP BY table_schema;
```
= 3599.00000000 mb
