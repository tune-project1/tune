# Install via Dockerfile

Tune has a Dockerfile you install locally or on your server.

Alternatives we have ready-to-go images served via [Github Registry hub](https://github.com/tune-co/tune/pkgs/container/tune).

---

Before we jump in, you'll need to have a mysql connection string ready. If you're using a service like Coolify, Dokploy or something similar, you can easily set this up inside their ui.

For local installations, you can use MAMP or something similar.

### Step 1. Install Docker

For local installations, you can install [Docker desktop from here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).

On your VPS server, you'll need to install docker via the command line.

### Step 2. Pull the docker image

We have prebuild Docker images available at https://github.com/tune-co/tune/pkgs/container/tune

Just run `docker pull ghcr.io/tune-co/tune:latest` and this will pull the latest Tune image.

### Step 3. Configure ports & env

**Ports** 

Ops's dockerfile will require 2 ports. One for the frontend, other for the backend. You can pass ports via the -p switch.

**Env vars**

You'll need to pass the `DATABASE_URL` env as a bare minimum.

Here's a basic example with ports and env vars:

```bash
docker run -d \
-p 80:80 \
-p 4337:4337 \
-e DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/tune"
```

Note that the backslashes are for breaking the command up into multiple lines.

### Complete example

This example has everything you need for a proper production ready deployment

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 4337:4337 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/tune-staging" \
  -e VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:4337" \
  -e APP_URL="http://localhost" \
  -e VAPID_EMAIL="mailto:your-email@example.com" \
  -e VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="" \
  -e VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="" \
  -e RESEND="your-resend-key" \
  -e PORT=2000 \
  -e SECRET="your-secret" \
  -e ADMIN_EMAIL="shashwat.amin@yahoo.com" \
  -e REMOVE_EVENTS_AFTER="120" \
  -e REMOVE_TEST_EVENTS_AFTER="7" \
  -e CORS="" \
  ops-test
```

- DATABASE_URL: mysql connection string
- VITE_API_URL: url of the backend.
- APP_URL: url of the frontend.
- VAPID_EMAIL: optional but recommended. Vapid credentials for push notifications
- VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY: same as above
- VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY: same as above
- RESEND: optional, for sending emails
- PORT: optional, port for the nodejs backend, defaults to 2000. Generally speaking, you don't need to modify this at all.
- SECRET: a long randomized string used for hashing passwords and sessions. Just enter a random string.
- ADMIN_EMAIL: optional, sets the email sender. If you have set RESEND, set this to one of your verified domain's emails.
- REMOVE_EVENTS_AFTER: optional, sets when a event is removed from the system. Defaults to one year.
- REMOVE_TEST_EVENTS_AFTER: optional, sets when a test event is removed from the system. Defaults to seven days.
- CORS: optional. If you've set APP_URL, you don't need this. But if your frontend can't connect to your backend, set this to "\*"

We have more documentation about [env vars here](/selfhosted/setup-env).

## Building the docker image manually

I don't recommend this since building from the Docker image is simpler. But if you want to modify the codebase locally, this guide might be for you.

- Clone the [github repo](https://github.com/tune-co/tune)
- `cd` into the repo
- Run `docker build -t tune .`
- The run the docker tune container.
