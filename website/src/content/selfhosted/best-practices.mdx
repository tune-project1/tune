# Self-hosting best practices


### Host Tune on a  VPS

A cheap VPS will give you the best bang-for-your-buck performance.

In our tests with Hetzner's Ampere CPU line, we found Tune to perform extremely well.

### Fork instead of git clone

Fork the project and git clone from there. There are two upsides:

- If we accidently push a breaking change, you won't be affected.
- Easier to migrate from. Once we release a version, just pull upstream for the new version number.

### Increase REMOVE_EVENTS_AT env var

This env var controls when events are flushed out of the system.

If you're using Tune as a audit log or something similar, you want to increase this to 2-3 years.

2 years = `REMOVE_EVENTS_AT="730"`
