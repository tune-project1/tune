# Install via Dockerfile

Tune has a Dockerfile you install locally or on your server.

Alternatives we have ready-to-go images served via [Github Registry hub](https://github.com/tune-co/tune/pkgs/container/tune).

## Install via Coolify

Coolify is a Docker manager. It can control your VPS and install applications for you.

Here's a video on setting up Tune via Coolify:

**Steps**

1. Setup a VPS
2. Connect Coolify to VPS
3. Setup a Coolify project
4. Create a mysql database
  Save the connection string for env vars

5. Setup a Docker image
  Get the Docker image url from [here](https://github.com/tune-co/tune/pkgs/container/tune).
6. Enter env vars
  You'll need these vars:

  - APP_URL: set this to the default url Coolify assigns(you can change this later on)
  - DATABASE_URL: set this as the connection string of the mysql database you've setup earlier
  - PORT: set this to 2000
  - VITE_API_URL: set this to the backend url

You'll need to also create a backend url manually. To do this, copy this code and paste it inside your Coolify Docker image's container label textarea:
<Code lang="bash">
```
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.rule=Host(`api-yourfrontendurl`)
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.entryPoints=http
traefik.http.routers.backend-4337.service=backend-4337
traefik.http.services.backend-4337.loadbalancer.server.port=4337
```
</Code>

And replace the api-yourfrontendurl with the frontend url from Coolify, but prepend `api-` before it.

And paste this in the VITE_API_URL as the value

7. Deploy

---

Keeping your database seperate from the Docker application is a good idea because you can easily update your docker image in the future if needed, and your database will be intact.

PS, if you're using something like Dokploy, Komo.do, etc, the steps are almost same. What differs between these platforms is how they handle urls and ports.

## Install via Docker locally

### Step 1. Install Docker

For local installations, you can install [Docker desktop from here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).

On your VPS server, you'll need to install docker via the command line.

### Step 2. Clone the repo

Clone the repo at https://github.com/tune-co/tune


### Step 3. Configure ports & env

**Ports** 

Ops's dockerfile will require 2 ports. One for the frontend, other for the backend. You can pass ports via the -p switch.

**Env vars**

You'll need to pass the `DATABASE_URL` env as a bare minimum.

Here's a basic example with ports and env vars:

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
docker run -d \
-p 80:80 \
-p 4337:4337 \
-e DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/tune"
```
</Code>

Note that the backslashes are for breaking the command up into multiple lines.

### Complete example

This example has everything you need for a proper production ready deployment

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 4337:4337 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:qKz7y26Q2wp3@49.13.149.99:9009/tune-staging" \
  -e VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:4337" \
  -e APP_URL="http://localhost" \
  -e VAPID_EMAIL="mailto:your-email@example.com" \
  -e VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="" \
  -e VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="" \
  -e RESEND="your-resend-key" \
  -e PORT=2000 \
  -e SECRET="your-secret" \
  -e ADMIN_EMAIL="shashwat.amin@yahoo.com" \
  -e REMOVE_EVENTS_AT="120" \
  -e REMOVE_TEST_EVENTS_AT="7" \
  -e CORS="" \
  ops-test
```
</Code>

- DATABASE_URL: mysql connection string
- VITE_API_URL: url of the backend.
- APP_URL: url of the frontend.
- VAPID_EMAIL: optional but recommended. Vapid credentials for push notifications
- VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY: same as above
- VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY: same as above
- RESEND: optional, for sending emails
- PORT: optional, port for the nodejs backend, defaults to 2000. Generally speaking, you don't need to modify this at all.
- SECRET: a long randomized string used for hashing passwords and sessions. Just enter a random string.
- ADMIN_EMAIL: optional, sets the email sender. If you have set RESEND, set this to one of your verified domain's emails.
- REMOVE_EVENTS_AT: optional, sets when a event is removed from the system. Defaults to one year.
- REMOVE_TEST_EVENTS_AT: optional, sets when a test event is removed from the system. Defaults to seven days.
- CORS: optional. If you've set APP_URL, you don't need this. But if your frontend can't connect to your backend, set this to "\*"
