Once you've setup your instance, open your browser and go to the frontend url.

Here, we have a onboarding process where you'll be asked to create your account.

Here are the steps:

### Check connection

This is a basic check to see whether the app can connect to the server.

If successful, it will show you some stats about the server.
If not, it will tell you what went wrong. Most likely this will be due to CORS issues. Make sure you've set correct env vars.

### Create your account

Next, you'll be asked to create your account.

Once created you can't create another account(unless you delete your account from the database) and the onboarding steps won't show up again.

### Api key

Next, you'll be shown your API key.

That's all.

Remember - inside the Playground all code examples should work out-of-the-box since they will have your api key and the baseUrl will be set to your API_URL.

After completing the onboarding process, I highly recommend reading through the [Manual](https://tune/manual/introduction).
